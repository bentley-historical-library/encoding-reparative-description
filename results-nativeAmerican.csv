229,umich-bhl-92745,"Ed Beach photographs, 1931-1948","Ed Beach was an amateur photographer whose photographs document his hometown of Howell, Michigan and historical sites in other Michigan communities. His collection consists of photographic negatives (with some prints) and albums with prints of historic plaques and markers, statues of famous statesmen and their gravesites, early school buildings, historic houses, gristmills, sawmills, and county courthouses.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Ed Beach collection consists of photographic negatives (with some prints) and albums with prints of historic plaques and markers, statues of famous statesmen and their gravesites, early school buildings, historic houses, gristmills, sawmills, and county courthouses. Other subjects include tourist sites in Michigan (such as Greenfield Village or Mackinac Island) and state parks, especially those in the Upper Peninsula. His hometown of Howell, Michigan is also heavily documented.

 The Beach collection is arranged into three series. In the Kodak series the negatives measure 2 3/4 by 4 1/2 inches in size and cover the years 1931 to 1948. The Leica series consists of 35-millimeter strips and were taken between the years 1936 and 1938. The third series consists of seven albums of carefully identified photographs.

 An item-level listing of the contents of the Kodak and Leica series is available at the library. To aid researchers a geographic and subject index has been created and is attached to this finding aid. These indices provide the best introduction to the collection.

 Beach created the photograph albums around broad topics, and each has a title. The albums include: ""Michigan Historic Places,"" ""Around Lake Erie in Ontario. Trip to Chicago Century of Progress,"" ""Michigan Courthouses,"" ""Michigan Ships, Monuments, Historic Places, Buildings, Creek Scenes,"" ""Indian and Trail Markers,"" ""Around Michigan: Historic Places, Buildings, Mills, Dams, Bridges, Masonic Buildings,"" and ""Michigan Governors' Homes, Michigan Trees, Old Buildings of Michigan."" The photos in the albums include Beach's negative number.","William E. Beach, known to all as Ed Beach, was an insurance salesman and an  avid amateur photographer, interested in historic sites in Michigan and the eastern U.S. Beach covered the entire state of Michigan and photographed many small towns and villages.

 He also documented the daily life of his hometown, Howell, Michigan, and photographed street scenes, delivery trucks, new buildings and roads under construction, gas stations, parades, storm and fire damage and prized possessions such as a car or a cow. Beach was also an active Mason and photographed many Masonic events and temples throughout the state. His photographs serve as candid documents of life in a small town in Michigan in the 1930's and 1940's.",3784; 3785; 3663; 3786; 3787; 3788; 3789; 3790; 3791; 3792; 3793; 6130; 3794; 3795; 3796; 3797;

256,umich-bhl-93291,"Fred E. Benz motion picture collection, 1929-1950",Amateur photographer; sixty-two reels of film shot by Benz on various trips.,The finding aid is written in English,"When the University of Michigan Media Resources Collection was accessioned by the Bentley Historical Library, a number of films were discovered in the vault that were not related to that collection. Within that material were travel films shot by Fred E. Benz. These films document Benz's travels around the world between 1929 and 1950. The films had been edited together and were probably used by Benz for presentation to local groups and as home entertainment.

 The Fred E. Benz Collection contains sixty-two, 400 foot reels of silent 16mm film. It is made up of eight series, one for each trip taken. The series are: Africa, Australia/New Zealand, Guatemala, Havana, Mexico, Russia, South America, and a World Cruise. 
 
 The contents of each reel are described in the finding aid. Benz has included handwritten descriptions of the images found on the Russian and World Cruise series attached to the inside lids of each can of film. Benz was careful to document most of the locations with a handwritten note displayed before the camera. When cities or natural markers are noted in the finding aid, the identifying information was taken from that supplied by the film maker on the screen or from his notes in the can lids. The spelling of geographic locations in the finding aid reflect the information on the film and not current spellings.

 Short notes found with the Mexican footage indicate it was the result of two different trips. The reels retain their original numbering because the numbered reels (1,2,3,4) appear to comprise one trip and numbered/lettered reels (1a, 3a, 4a) comprise the second trip.

 The value of the collection is that it captures moments in time, documenting lifestyles, architecture and modes of travel which no longer exist or have evolved over time. Footage exists of London on the eve of war and Shanghai one year before being destroyed by the Japanese invasion.

 Perhaps the greater value lies in the depiction of the indigenous lifestyles captured on film. Benz, as an amateur photographer, was interested in the common events that he experienced as he traveled. The collection features extensive recordings of people working or playing, and children of different cultures going about their daily activities. The films show barren huts in remote areas of Russia in the 1930s, families living under stone bridges outside of Buenos Aires, life-saving competitions in Sydney and the plethora of street markets found in most cultures and countries that he traveled through.

 Because these are travel films, the scope of the footage included often extends beyond the geographic area used to identify the series. For example, the Australia footage includes material filmed on various Pacific islands, the Asian continent and Japan. The Russian trip contains footage of England and Northern Europe, and the South American films contain shots of the departure from New York. Each series should be examined for additional geographic content.

 Special attention should be given to the Mexican series containing film recordings of Mt. Rushmore with construction only partially complete. Included as well are extensive shots of bullfighting in addition to other Mexican scenes. Also of note is the extensive depiction of women throughout all of the series. On the canister containing reel 5 in the Russia series is a receipt from United States Navy Department stating that this reel was being forwarded to Chicago for study of the shots of Kirkenes, Norway.

 The color in the Africa, Guatemala, Havana, Mexico and South America series is excellent. The wide, clean, lush cityscapes of Havana and Capetown are richly captured in color and give an indication why they were popular travel destinations at this time.

 In addition to the eight travel series, the collection also included one reel of World War II footage assembled by Castle Films from public domain footage. This type of film was sold through camera stores and mail order houses and Benz probably purchased a reel for his own use. The identifying writing on the film can is in Benz's handwriting and clearly belonged with his collection.","In 1911, Fred Benz, an Ann Arbor, Michigan native, joined his brothers Victor and Albert in their agricultural implements and feed business called Benz Brothers. Throughout the 1910s decade, the brothers expanded their interests into the area of automotive accessories. In the early 1920s, they opened a Chevrolet dealership. Fred retained an interest in the business but relinquished the operation of Benz Brothers to Albert and became the treasurer of the Ann Arbor Finance Company in 1928. In 1931, he left that position and became vice-president and secretary of The National Company of Ann Arbor. He retired in 1932 but retained his interest in the Benz Brothers operation. Very little additional information exists relating to Benz. He married in 1916 to a woman named Margaret and the marriage lasted until his death in 1963. Benz probably had an interest and skill in photography judging by the quality of the images and the ability with the camera displayed on the rolls of film in this collection.",3773; 3840; 3841; 3582; 6328; 3842; 6329; 3843; 3844; 3845; 6330; 3658; 3846; 3819; 3847; 3579; 5738; 6331,"Animals.; Bullfighting.; Cemeteries.; Children.; Church architecture.; Country life.; Indigenous peoples.; Lifesaving.; Markets.; Peasants.; Pygmies.; Rites and ceremonies.; Transportation.; Travel.; Waterfalls.; Women.; World War, 1939-1945.; World War, 1939-1945",lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh,3169,Motion pictures.,aat,1281; 861; 1282; 1273; 1283; 1284; 947; 1285; 1286; 1287; 1288; 1289; 1262; 949; 979; 1290; 1277; 1291; 1292; 1293; 1294; 1295; 1296; 1297; 1298,Africa.; Ann Arbor (Mich.); Southeast Asia.; Australia.; Brazil.; California.; China; Cuba.; Denmark.; England.; Finland.; Guatemala.; Hawaii.; Japan.; Mexico.; Mount Rushmore National Memorial (S.D.); Netherlands.; New Zealand.; Norway.; Oceania.; Poland.; Puerto Rico.; San Francisco Bay Area (Calif.); Soviet Union.; Sweden.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,6041,"Benz, Fred E., -1963",lcnaf,,,,,,

Includes visual materials, publications, personal writings, and extensive correspondence files.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Blanchard Family Papers document the professional achievements and personal lives of several generations of a scientifically minded and artistically gifted family. The papers focus heavily upon the eminent plant pathologist and nematologist Nathan A. Cobb, his wife Alice Vara Cobb, their daughter, biologist Frieda Cobb Blanchard, and her husband, herpetologist Frank Nelson Blanchard (the latter two of whom were professors at the University of Michigan). In addition to the photographs, drawings, correspondence, journals, and writings of these four individuals, the collection is rich in family correspondence, diaries, and personal papers from other members of the Cobb and Blanchard families (and their forebears and branches, including the Bigelow, Proctor, Ross, White, and Randall families). The Blanchard Family Papers will be of value to researchers interested in a variety of topics: scientific endeavors and methodologies (and in particular those related to agronomy, nematology, botany, and herpetology); the visual arts and the development of photography in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; colonial and provincial life in Australia and Hawaii (respectively); and the daily affairs of American (and Michigan) families throughout the twentieth century. The Blanchard Family Papers consist of seven series: Nathan A. Cobb, Alice Vara Cobb, Frieda Cobb Blanchard, Frank Nelson Blanchard, Blanchard and Cobb Family Letters, Other Family Members, and Isaac G. Blanchard.","Nathan Augustus Cobb was born in Spencer, Massachusetts on June 30, 1859 to William H. and Jane (Bigelow) Cobb. His father, a Civil War veteran, worked variously as a carpenter, millwright, factory foreman, and farmer before he struck out for California in 1874, never to be seen again by his wife and only son. Despite the responsibility of supporting his mother as a farm laborer, Cobb graduated from Spencer High School and even maintained perfect attendance for numerous terms. In 1876 he moved onto the property of local businessman Charles N. Prouty and worked as a stable hand. Keenly interested in the natural world around him, Cobb saved his wages and purchased a microscope with which he gave informal lessons to the Prouty children. Encouraged by his employer, Cobb sat for the local schoolteachers' exam and was appointed headmaster of the Wire Village School before being promoted to the head of the No. 3 Grammar School in Spencer. During this time, he developed friendships with Fred Proctor and Joseph H. Greenwood, the latter of who introduced Cobb to drawing and painting and eventually gained renown as a New England landscape artist.

 As a result of his close bond with Fred Procter, Cobb lodged with the Proctor family at the outset of his teaching career. Edward Proctor, the <emph render=""italic"">pater familias</emph>, had settled in Franklin, Michigan (near Detroit) during the 1830s but returned to his native Massachusetts following the death of his first wife and a child in 1841. While residing in the household, Cobb became close with Alice Vara Proctor (born in Spencer on April 22, 1854), a fellow teacher, enthusiastic botanist, and skilled sketch artist. The two spent much time together studying plants and sketching their findings and were engaged in 1877.

 In 1878 Cobb enrolled in the Worcester Free Technical Institute (later renamed the Worcester Polytechnic Institute) and focused his studies on chemistry and mathematics. His thesis, ""Notes on Miller's Crystallography"" (1881), examined William Hallowes Miller's theorems in terms of analytical geometry and provided him with skills in mathematics, drafting, and optics that would be invaluable to his later work.

 Upon graduating in 1881, Cobb married Alice and began teaching at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts. In addition to chemistry, Cobb taught zoology, physiology, botany, and geology and also developed courses in architectural design, mechanical drawing, and topography. During their residence in Easthampton, the Cobbs had four children: Russell (b. July 10, 1882, d. March 26, 1884), Margaret (b. May 16, 1884, d. November, 1963), Victor (b. October 11, 1885, d. April 24, 1946), and Roger (b. July 28, 1887, d. January 13, 1901) and made in depth studies of the local flora and fauna.

 Despite his great skills in the physical sciences, Cobb's interests gradually turned to the life sciences and in 1887 he was accepted into the University of Jena in Germany to study under the eminent biologist, naturalist, artist, and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. In addition to practical considerations of lithography, photomicrography, and general zoological methods, Cobb's studies dealt intimately with helminthology and parasitology. Published in 1888, his thesis (<title render=""italic"">Beitrage zur anatomie und Onogenie der Nematoden</title>) examined parasitic and free-living nematodes--subject matter with which he would be associated for the rest of his life.

 In 1888 Cobb and his family made a brief tour of Germany before repairing to Naples where (at the recommendation of the pioneering marine biologist Sir John Murray) he held a seat at the oceanographic research table of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In early 1889 the family departed for Australia where they arrived on March 7, 1889. Despite recommendations from Haeckel to the Government Botanist of Victoria, scientific work was not immediately forthcoming for Cobb and he was forced to produce advertisements for Waterbury watches and other articles for the American importer Chipman. He did, however, join the Linnaean Society of New South Wales in 1889 and later that year received a temporary appointment at the University of Sydney.

 When the government of New South Wales (NSW) formed a Department of Agriculture in 1890, Cobb was appointed as the colony's first vegetable pathologist. In this position he was instrumental in helping Australian farmers find solutions to a variety of pests and diseases and implement more efficient agricultural methods. He also helped develop modern laboratories for the Department of Agriculture, established a definitive reference collection, and promoted effective research methodologies. Given his natural curiosity, Cobb examined a great many issues as a plant pathologist; he is most remembered, however, for his work with sheep flukes, sugar cane (especially the bacterial affliction known as 'gumming'), diseases affecting fruit crops, the eradication of wheat rust, and investigation of alternative wheat growing practices. Much of his work--far more varied than what is possible to review here--was collected in the <title render=""italic"">Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales</title>. Cobb also had responsibility for the Wagga Wagga Experimental Farm and Farm School, was associated with the Hawkesbury Agricultural College, and worked closely with the agronomist William Farrer. Cobb is remembered in Australia as a foundational figure in the development and modernization of the country's agriculture and has been referred to as ""the Father of Scientific Agricultural Research in Australia.""

 In 1899 Cobb was named a Special Commissioner to the United States and Europe (a half-time appointment) by the Government of New South Wales and embarked on a two and a half year world tour to promote Australian agriculture and exports and to research modern agricultural practices. By this time, the Cobb family had grown through the arrival of Frieda (b. October 2, 1889, d. August 29, 1977), Ruth (b. April 25, 1891, d. June 18, 1983), and Dorothy (b. October 28, 1892, d. 1977?). While in America, the family remained with relatives in Massachusetts during Cobb's travels. A major result of these sojourns was an extensive report on grain elevators and the mechanization of agriculture in California. The Cobbs' travels included stops in Europe (France, Germany, Denmark, and elsewhere) as well as Algeria before returning to the United States and setting sail for Australia in late 1900 aboard the S.S. Sierra out of San Francisco. Tragedy struck the family upon its return to Australia; Roger was struck ill with cholera and died shortly after the ship docked in January, 1901.

 Upon his return to Australia, Cobb learned that Farrer had replaced him as the government's wheat experimentalist. Although he briefly entertained a 1902 offer from James Wilson, Head of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), to become the Chief of the Bureau of Tropical Agriculture in Manila, Cobb elected to stay on with the NSW Department of Agriculture. As their children approached university age, however, the Cobbs determined to move back to the United States and so Nathan spent a good portion of 1902-1904 corresponding with contacts and took leave in 1904 to visit his homeland.

 Cobb's efforts bore fruit when, in 1905, he completed negotiations to become the Director of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association's (HSPA) Division of Plants and Pathology. In the laboratory he personally designed at the HSPA Experiment Station, Cobb conducted considerable research into fungal and parasitic diseases (including nematode infestation) in sugarcane and other tropical fruits. He accepted this opening with a fixed term as he had made arrangements with the USDA for a position that would be ""more congenial"" to his overall interests to be held until his work in Hawaii was completed.

 In 1907, Nathan became an Agricultural Technologist with the USDA's Bureau of Plant Industry and the family moved east, eventually settling in Falls Church, Virginia. In the initial phase of his employment, much of Cobb's work dealt with the standardization of cotton grades and measurement of cotton staple. Although he was transferred to different research in 1915, he was awarded the following year a medal by the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers for his development of a patented method and apparatus to determine the length of cotton fibers. In his newly refocused role, Cobb investigated the economic impact of nematodes on agriculture and became a powerful advocate for the establishment of nematology as a distinct field of scientific inquiry and the formation of a separate division within the USDA devoted to this study. Indeed, his writings from 1912 onwards made a definitive case for the separation of nematology from helminthology and also established the standards for laboratory methodologies and techniques that would guide future generations of nematologists. By 1918 the USDA recognized his laboratory as the Bureau of Plant Industry's Division of Nematology and Cobb had become the government's chief nematologist.

 Although his active intellect found many outlets, much of the remainder of Cobb's life would be devoted to the study of nematodes (or 'nema' as he referred to them). He is widely regarded as the 'Father of Nematology' and the Society of Nematologists has named a foundation in his honor. In addition to his work within the government, Cobb produced a series of works known as ""Contributions to a Science of Nematology"", which, with their richly illustrated plates, form a basic reference in the field and is still consulted at the dawn of the twenty-first century.

 In his later years, Cobb became an avid birdwatcher and served as an officer of various scientific organizations, including the American Microscopical Society, the Helminthological Society of Washington, the American Society of Parasitology, and the Washington Academy of Science. Beyond his accomplishments as a plant pathologist and zoologist, Cobb held numerous patents related to cameras, microscopes, and other practical implements. Nathan A. Cobb died suddenly of a heart attack on June 4, 1932 while in Johns Hopkins Hospital for his annual medical evaluation. Margaret Vara Cobb helped complete his ""Key to the Genera of Free-Living Nematodes"" (published in 1935) and Frieda Cobb Blanchard wrote an extensive biography of her father that first appeared in the <title render=""italic"">Asa Gray Bulletin</title> in 1957 and has since proven an invaluable resource for subsequent biographers. Alice Vara Cobb survived her husband and lived until 1951. Her recollections of her early life with Nathan (collected by her daughter, Frieda Cobb Blanchard and title ""As I remember it..."") were invaluable in tracing their lives' paths.

 Frieda Cobb Blanchard was born in New South Wales, Australia in 1889 and she developed an aptitude for drawing and an interest in the scientific world at an early age. Having assisted her father in his home laboratories in Australia, she began to work with him at the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Experiment Station after the family moved to Honolulu in 1905. She later completed high school in Washington, D.C. and attended Radcliffe College for three years before returning to Falls Church, Virginia to assist her father in his home laboratory. She eventually completed her B.S. in general science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1916. After studying nematodes with her father at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Frieda moved to Ann Arbor at the express request of Dr. Harley H. Bartlett (a Harvard classmate of her brother, Victor). In addition to pursuing graduate studies at the University of Michigan and working as Bartlett's graduate assistant, she was appointed Assistant Director of the University of Michigan's Botanical Gardens. She earned her Ph.D. in genetics in 1920 (studying Mendelian inheritance in evening primroses) and continued to work at the Botanical Gardens, serving as the active administrator during Bartlett's frequent research trips. In 1922, Frieda married herpetologist and Michigan professor Frank N. Blanchard with whom she had three children (Frank Nelson, Grace, and Dorothy) and collaborated professionally (achieving the first demonstration of Mendelian inheritance in reptiles). After Frank's unexpected death in 1937, Frieda raised the children on her own and continued her research and teaching activities as well as her work at the Botanical Gardens. Frieda Cobb Blanchard lived in Ann Arbor for the rest of her life and died in 1977.

 Frank Nelson Blanchard was born in 1888 in Stoneham, Massachusetts and in 1913 graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in biology. He taught zoology for three years (1913-1916) at the Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst before pursuing his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Michigan. In Ann Arbor, Frank studied under noted professor Alexander G. Ruthven; he wrote his dissertation on king snakes and received his doctorate in 1919. After working as an aide from 1918-1920 in the Smithsonian Institution's Division of Reptiles, he became a professor at the University of Michigan in 1920 and married Frieda Cobb in 1922. He performed extensive field research at the University of Michigan's Biological Station and across the U.S., often with Frieda, his students, and various collaborators such as Howard K. Gloyd. Although Blanchard was recognized as a leading authority on North American snakes, he devoted considerable research to salamanders and the life histories of both these species. Respected by his colleagues, Frank N. Blanchard was especially well-liked by his students; his unexpected passing in 1937 after a brief illness was much lamented at the University of Michigan and the herpetological world in general.

 Isaac Gray Blanchard, the paternal grandfather of Frank N. Blanchard, was born in Charlotte, Maine on October 29, 1819 and was the oldest of David and Saviah (Bennett) Blanchard's ten children. The family lived in a relatively unsettled part of Maine (18 miles from the town of Eastport) and David made his living as a farmer and tradesman. Isaac read extensively to supplement the somewhat limited education provided by the local school and by his teens he regularly submitted poetry and prose pieces to area newspapers (most notably the <title render=""italic"">Eastport Sentinel</title>). He continued to write poetry for the rest of his life (as well as fiction and, in his later years, an unfinished autobiography) and was a frequent contributor to newspaper editorial pages through his final years. As a young man, Blanchard had a three-year apprenticeship in the printing business at the <title render=""italic"">Sentinel</title> and in addition to working his father's farm and teaching in district schools, he served as the Town Clerk. During this time he also studied Pitman's phonography and taught this system of shorthand writing in lectures and correspondence courses. In 1849, he removed to Boston, worked as a typesetter for several publishers, and soon thereafter became an associate editor of a literary and scientific journal. By this time, Blanchard had married Margaret E. Johnson, with whom he had five children (including Charles Frederick Blanchard, the father of Frank N.), the eldest of whom was born in 1850. That same year he partnered with C. C. Tyler of Eastport to purchase the <title render=""italic"">East Boston Ledger</title>; he would run the paper for 12 years before poor health and scant profits forced him to sell out. Blanchard then graduated from Dio Lewis's Normal Institute for Physical Education in 1863 and was a ""New Gymnastics"" instructor before becoming the editor-in-chief of the <title render=""italic"">Boston Daily Voice</title>. Although he had long harbored progressive ideas, Blanchard's service with this cooperative newspaper precipitated his increased involvement in the nascent labor movement in the United States. He attended the second session of the National Labor Union in 1868, wrote extensively on labor issues and the inequalities of the capitalist system, contributed editorials to newspapers such as <title render=""italic"">American Workman</title> and <title render=""italic"">The People's Paper</title>, and in 1870 self-published a collection of labor songs under the title ""Rhymes for the Times."" After the <title render=""italic"">Daily Voice</title> failed, Blanchard tried (and failed) in a number of endeavors (one venture was destroyed in the great Boston fire of 1872) before moving to Clay County, Florida in 1877. In spite of the somewhat strained relations endemic to the post-Reconstruction South, Blanchard took an active role in his community: he raised a variety of crops (and helped charter a Farmers' Club in 1884); donated land for a public school and assembly hall in 1879; and taught a variety of subjects once the school was opened. Although he had been an early convert to Christianity and had lectured publicly on Millerism in his youth, Blanchard rejected formal religion in his young adulthood and instead grew increasingly interested in spiritualism. He wrote a series of articles in 1855 in the <title render=""italic"">Eastport Sentinel</title> on the manifest reality of spirits, was close with a number of mediums, and attended numerous séances in both New England and Florida. Isaac Blanchard died on February 5, 1885 in Highlands, Florida. (Information in this biography was gleaned from George Bancroft Griffith's <title render=""italic"">The Poets of Maine</title> (1888)).",6411; 6412; 6413; 6414; 6415; 6416; 6417; 6418; 6419; 6420; 5800; 6421; 6422; 3876; 3774; 6414; 3877; 3878; 3879; 3880; 3777,Herpetology.; Inventors.; Labor movement; Nematodes.; Plant diseases.; Professors.; Research.; Scientists.; Spiritualism; Technological innovations; Women; Women; Women; Agriculture.; Birds.; Nematodes.; Plant diseases.; Ships.; Snakes.; Sugar cane; Zoology.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3152; 3190; 3205; 3206; 3479; 3207; 3142,Diaries.; Drawings.; Lantern slides.; Negatives (photographic); Scientific illustrations.; Sketches.; Photographs.,aat; aat; aat; aat; gmgpc; aat; aat,974; 1323; 1324; 1325; 1273; 1262,Ann Arbor (Mich.); Australia; Hawaii; Massachusetts; Australia.; Hawaii.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,2334; 2703; 9070; 5652; 2752; 3567; 2703; 9070; 2752; 3567; 2334; 2703; 9070; 5652; 2752; 3567,"Blanchard, Florence A.; Blanchard, Frank Nelson, 1888-1937; Blanchard, Frieda Cobb.; Blanchard, Isaac G.; Cobb, Alice Vara.; Cobb, Nathan Augustus, 1859-1932; Blanchard, Frank Nelson, 1888-1937; Blanchard, Frieda Cobb.; Cobb, Alice Vara.; Cobb, Nathan Augustus, 1859-1932; Blanchard, Florence A.; Blanchard, Frank Nelson, 1888-1937; Blanchard, Frieda Cobb.; Blanchard, Isaac G.; Cobb, Alice Vara.; Cobb, Nathan Augustus, 1859-1932",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,2188; 1722; 4638; 397; 1914; 4310; 2188; 1722; 4638; 397; 1914,Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association.

As a young man he had already expressed interest in the study of human origins, reason for which he pursued an undergraduate degree in Geology at Williams College, which he obtained in 1952. The College lacked an anthropology program so Brace combined courses in geology, biology, and philosophy to fulfill his interests.

 C. Loring Brace, as he is known, went on to Harvard for a Master's degree in anthropology. His studies there were interrupted when Earnest A. Hooton, his professor, passed away and Brace was drafted for military service in 1954. On his return from active duty, Brace went to Maine where he did research on physical and behavioral relations among dogs at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory. Once he returned to Harvard, a year later, he did further analysis and research on the same topic to complete what would be his thesis. He received his Master's degree in 1958 and would receive his Ph.D. in 1962 from the same institution. It was during his time in Harvard that Brace met his future wife Mary L. Crozier. ""Mimi"" worked at the Peabody Museum where he was also doing research. She would go on to do some research with him and illustrate his books.

 During the course of his doctoral study, National Science Foundation and fellowship support allowed him to do field work in Abri Pataud, France, and research on museum collections in several European countries including Italy, Switzerland, Austria, France, Germany, and Great Britain. Brace also analyzed Neanderthal fossils in the Krapina region in former Yugoslavia. After examining remains and collections in multiple institutions in Europe, Brace spent the 1960 winter term at Oxford with the support of Nikolaas Tinbergen.

 After completing his doctoral studies at Harvard under the direction of William W. Howells, Brace went on to teach at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee as Instructor in Anthropology in 1960. The following year he was invited to the University of California, Santa Barbara as Associate Professor of Anthropology. He taught there until 1965. Brace, during his time in Milwaukee and in Santa Barbara, was instrumental in driving the creation of anthropology departments independent from former joint Sociology and Anthropology Departments. Brace went on to teach at the University of Michigan as Associate Professor of Anthropology and Curator of Physical Anthropology at the University's Museum of Anthropology. In 1971 he obtained full professorship.

 In subsequent years Brace traveled through England, the Netherlands, Italy, Israel, South Africa, East Africa, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia collecting dental and cranial measurements of populations and of hominid remains. During this time he also taught as visiting professor in institutions such as the University of Auckland, New Zealand (1973), University of Hawaii (1979), and Rollins College in Florida (1987). Brace had also done some short-term summer teaching during his time in Wisconsin and at the University of Colorado.

 From early in his career Brace actively published through academic journals in anthropology and related fields, through his own books and in popular media as well. Among his well-known publications are <title render=""italic"">The Stages of Human Evolution: Human and Cultural Origins</title>, <title render=""italic"">Evolution in an Anthropological View</title>, and <title render=""italic"">Race is a Four Letter Word</title>.

 Brace work is known for his claim that Neanderthals are one of four stages of human evolution and thus are ancestors to Homo Sapiens. His detailed and wide-ranging research on dentition and cranio-facial features led him to maintain that structural reduction can result from selection relaxation, also known as the Probable Mutation Effect. This was highlighted in his research on Asian populations where tooth size reduction and continuity resulted from cultural practices. His research also explored the origins of the 'race' concept, its development and application and how its use has been biologically unsupported. He suggests using the 'clines' concept and geographical names for population clusters.

 In 2006 the American Association of Physical Anthropology honored Brace's achievements in the anthropological field with the Charles Darwin lifetime achievement award. His work has also been recognized by colleagues in the filed through the publication <title render=""italic"">Professor C. Loring Brace: Bringing Physical Anthropology (""Kicking and Screaming"" Into the 21st Century!</title> In 2008, Brace retired from his long career at the University of Michigan.

The rest of the collection consists of the personal papers of Ira Butterfield. These papers relate to his experiences in World War II, his legal career, charitable and personal interests. The majority of these personal papers relate to his various campaigns for public office. The collection is divided into six series: First Congregational Church, Bay City, MI; Military Service; Bay County Council on Delinquency; Campaigns; Archaeology and Photographs. Although the collection contains some records dating from before 1944, the majority date from 1944 to 1990. Some earlier materials may be found in the First Congregational Church of Bay City collection, also held by the Bentley Library.","Ira W. Butterfield was born in Bay City, Michigan on January 30, 1915, the son of George E. Butterfield, a Bay City educator, and Esther Butterfield. He was the valedictorian of Bay City High School's graduating class of 1933. After attending Bay City Junior College, he transferred over to the University of Michigan in 1935. Working on a combined course program in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and the Law School, Butterfield received his B.A. in 1937 and his law degree in 1940.

 Returning to Bay City after his graduation, he served as an assistant to the City Attorney and then in 1942 left to serve as a Law Clerk to the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1944 he was inducted into the infantry and commissioned in 1945. On July 5, 1945 he married the former Eleanor Meyers, and they eventually had two children, Miriam and Robert. He continued his career in the Army by serving in the Judge Advocate General's Department in 1946 while stationed in the Philippines. After the war he returned once again to Bay City and entered private practice.

 Ira Butterfield was very active in politics. In 1956 he was elected County Prosecuting Attorney for Bay County, a position which he held for two years, from 1957 to 1958. After an unsuccessful bid for reelection he once again returned to private practice. In 1968 Butterfield was elected to the newly created position of District Judge in the 74th District Court. He served from January 1, 1969 until 1978 when he resigned to accept Governor Milliken's appointment as circuit court judge for the 18th Judicial Circuit. He served here until his term expired January 1, 1981.

 Throughout his career Butterfield was active in a variety of professional organizations, including the following: Bay County Bar Association (Treasurer 1943, Vice President 1953, President 1954), and as a member of the State Bar of Michigan, the American Judicature Society, and the American Bar Association. Ira Butterfield also served his community in a variety of volunteer organizational activities, including: the Bay County Council on Juvenile Delinquency (President 1947-49); Bay County Historical Society (President and Treasurer); Michigan Archaeological Society (State President 1956-57); and Gubernatorial Recount Board, Bay County (1950 and 1952).

 Ira Butterfield was very interested in the First Congregational Church of Bay City. Along with his father, George Butterfield, Ira Butterfield served the church in various capacities, as moderator, clerk, Sunday school superintendent, chairman of the trustees, and chairman of the deacons.

 Of considerable interest to Butterfield while he was associated with the church was the rift that developed in the 1950s between the minister and members of the congregation. The Reverend Thomas Vernon became minister of the church in 1947, and by the early 1950s disagreement had developed between him and one section of the congregation (which included the Butterfield family) over his theology. This group felt that the minister was forcing out longtime members who disagreed with his views, and ""packing"" the membership with his own supporters. The minister, in return, charged that the dissenters were traditionalists who were intolerant of any beliefs other than their own.

 The controversy escalated throughout the 1950s. The dissenting group accused the minister and his supporters of altering records and manipulating the church constitution, church membership, and church organizations in order to move the church away from congregationalism. The minister charged that the dissenting group represented a minority which would use any means to get rid of him because of his liberal views, and insisted that his actions were true to the spirit of congregationalism. The move on the national level during the late 1950s to merge the Congregational and Evangelical and Reformed denominations into the United Church of Christ added further complexity to the situation, with the minister siding with those who wanted to remain more strictly congregational.

 Despite the protests, in 1957 the congregation voted to retain Rev. Vernon as minister. Eventually, the dissenting group ceased to participate in church activities, organized itself into the Christian Congregational Association, hired a lawyer, and moved to call an Ecclesiastical Council of the Central Association of Congregational Christian Churches of Michigan. They petitioned to have the church declared extinct as a congregational church, and if successful, their goal was to proceed to civil courts to have the corporation dissolved and to regain control of the church property.

 The Ecclesiastical Council was held on November 13, 1957, and in December it denied the petition to declare the church extinct. The report of the Ecclesiastical Council concluded that each side had some basis for its charges, and sharply criticized the behavior of both parties. The Council recommended that Rev. Vernon resign within one year, and in 1959, Rev. Vernon and some former members of the First Congregational Church founded the First Unitarian Church of Bay City.

 After the controversy, the Butterfield family again became active in church affairs, attempting to reverse a steady decline in membership. By 1985 the First Congregational Church was sharing a minister with the First United Church of Christ of Bay City and consideration was being given to a merger of the two churches. The First Congregational Church decided against this option, however, and continued to operate separately.

Groesbeck, and state director of conservation, John Baird; also copies of correspondence collected by Ivan Conger.

 Photographs include pictures taken on hunting and fishing trips to British Columbia, the Canadian Northwest, and other areas of Canada; portraits; and photos of the Saginaw River (Michigan), and of pollution caused by the Michigan Sugar Company; also one film (two videotape copies), including scenes from <title render=""italic"">God's Country and the Law</title>.","The papers, 1897-1927, of James Oliver Curwood include correspondence; scrapbooks; and manuscripts of articles, books, and movie scenarios. The correspondence, arranged chronologically, deals primarily with three topics: that from 1897 to 1918 relates largely to Curwood's literary efforts; that from 1918 to 1921 concerns a mixture of literary and motion picture matters; and that from 1921 to 1927 focuses on conservation in Michigan.

 Curwood, a contemporary and acquaintance of Zane Grey and Jack London, wrote adventure tales of the frozen north. His collection encompasses not only his major literary works, but also the numerous articles that he wrote for such magazines as Redbook, Cosmopolitan, Collier's, Munsey's, Outing, and Everybody's Magazine. During the second decade of this century, Curwood got involved in the infant motion picture industry, first as a writer for other companies and later as the head of James Oliver Curwood Productions. Consequently, his extensive correspondence with producers, directors, and business managers is quite revealing of the early development of movies.

 In the 1920's, Curwood became deeply involved with the conservation movement, not only in Michigan, but throughout the mid-west. He was a charter member and active participant in the Izaak Walton League, as well as a prominent critic of the Michigan Department of Conservation under John Baird. In 1927, Governor Green recognized Curwood's efforts by naming him to the Conservation Commission. His correspondence during this period covers a wide range of topics including water pollution, forest fire prevention, sport fishery development, and increased protection for some of Michigan's dwindling wildlife, principally deer and partridge. There is also a great deal of information on the corruption of the Baird administration, particularly the political nature of warden appointments, lax enforcement and flagrant disregard of game laws, and the utilization of the Conservation Department to build up a Republican political machine in Michigan.

Fox Papers are arranged in four series: Cass County, Archaeology and History Manuscripts, Correspondence, and Photographs. Many of the materials in the papers are undated.","George Randall Fox was born in Peabody, Kansas on May 18, 1880 and grew up in Wisconsin. After completing high school, Fox worked for the post office for a number of years, but his great passions were archaeology and writing. Around 1900, he began collecting Native American artifacts and exploring various mounds and rivers in Wisconsin. In the ensuing years, Fox traveled to the southeastern United States, Mexico, and the Galapagos Islands in his spare time, in addition to participating in an expedition to Isle Royale (his report of which was published in The Wisconsin Archaeologist in 1911) to pursue his archaeological interests. Fox also authored a number of fiction and non-fiction manuscripts, most of which were never published.

 In 1917 Mr. and Mrs. E.K. Warren asked Fox to serve for several months as the curator of a new museum they planned to establish in Three Oaks, Michigan called the Chamberlain Museum (the collections of the Chamberlain Museum later formed the basis of the Michigan State University Museum). After short stints at the Nebraska Historical Museum and back with the post office, he became the permanent curator several years later. In 1930, Fox left the museum to operate a camp for boys in Ontario for three years. He later moved to Cass County, worked for the city of Dowagiac, and founded a local historical society. Fox also wrote a column on Cass County local history for the <title render=""italic"">Dowagiac Daily News</title> and was a major contributor to <title render=""italic"">The Acorn</title>, another local paper.

 Fox was active in several archaeological organizations, including the Michigan Archaeological Society and the Central States Branch of the American Anthropological Association. He contributed a number of archaeological reports and articles to publications such as <title render=""italic"">The Wisconsin Archaeologist</title>, <title render=""italic"">Michigan History Magazine</title>, and <title render=""italic"">The Totem Pole</title> (a publication of the Aboriginal Research Club of Detroit). Fox was honored several times for his contributions to amateur archaeology. In 1926 the Wisconsin Archaeological Society awarded him the Lapham Medal for ""distinguished service in anthropological research."" In 1960 the Michigan Archaeological Society gave him a distinguished service award.

 Fox had three daughters and one son.

Gilmore (1868-1940) Papers,"Melvin Randolph Gilmore was one of the preeminent ethnobotanists of his generation and served as Curator of Ethnology for the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan from 1929 to 1939. The Gilmore Papers contain correspondence, topical files, field notes, photographs, and manuscripts related to his work among Native American groups of the Plains and Prairies, including the Arikara and the Omaha.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The Melvin R. Gilmore Papers consist of three series: Correspondence; Research, Writing, and Field Work; and Photographs. With the exception of the Correspondence series, much of the material in the papers is undated, but appears to date mainly from 1905 to 1930.","Melvin Randolph Gilmore was born on March 11, 1868 in Valley, Nebraska. Gilmore's father was a farmer, and as a young man, Gilmore worked the farm with him. He also served as a teacher in a local school, not finishing college until he was in his thirties. He received a bachelor's degree from Cotner College (later Cotner University) in 1904. He received both of his graduate degrees in botany from the University of Nebraska, a master's degree in 1909 and a doctorate in 1914.

 Gilmore served as a professor of botany and zoology at Cotner University from 1904 to 1911. He then became curator at the Nebraska State Historical Society from 1911 to 1916. From 1916 to 1923 Gilmore served as curator of the museum at the State Historical Society of North Dakota. He served on the staff of the Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian from 1923 to 1928. After most of the staff at the museum were abruptly let go due to financial difficulties in 1928, Gilmore moved to Michigan and worked as a landscape designer for the Kellogg Nature Preserve in Battle Creek. Gilmore was then hired as the first Curator of Ethnology for the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan in 1929. He was later given the additional title of Director of the Ethnobotanical Laboratory in 1938.

 Gilmore was one of the preeminent ethnobotanists of his generation. He was one of the first researchers to recognize the enormous botanical knowledge of Native Americans and to take it as his primary area of study. Much of Gilmore's ethnographic and ethnobotanical field work was done working among the Arikara (also known as the Sahnish), an agricultural Native American tribe based around the upper Missouri River. Gilmore also researched and spent time with a number of other Native American groups on the Prairies and Plains, including the Pawnee and the Omaha. Gilmore's most well-known publication was <title render=""italic"">Uses of Plants by the Indians of the Missouri River Region</title>, first published by the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1919 and considered a classic of the field. Other major publications included <title render=""italic"">Prairie Smoke</title> (Columbia University Press, 1929), a collection of Native American myths, and the pamphlet <title render=""italic"">Indian Lore and Indian Gardens</title> (Slingerland-Comstock Co., 1930).

 Gilmore's most significant accomplishment at Michigan was the establishment of the Ethnobotanical Laboratory, which began operation in 1930. Founded with support from the National Research Council, the laboratory served as a national center for the identification of archaeological vegetal material. Unfortunately, Gilmore was in poor health for much of his tenure at the university, and was not able to get very far with the work of the lab. By the mid-1930s he had ceded most of his museum and lab responsibilities to his assistant, Volney Jones, though he retained his museum titles until 1939.

 Gilmore died on July 25, 1940 in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Material on his business activities is, however, minimal. It is his archeological and historical work that the collection documents most thoroughly. Green's correspondence is full of reports, inquiries, and discussions about the theoretical and practical facets of archaeology, focusing largely upon fossil and artifact finds in southwestern Michigan; the letters also illuminate the occasionally trying relationship between professionals and amateurs in the field. The practical aspect of archaeology is documented, too, in an incomplete assortment of Green's site notes. Green's historical research interests are well represented in his correspondence, as well as in some interesting source material and notes on Ft. St. Joseph and on Jesuit missions in Berrien County. Most of Green's writings on both archaeology and history--in the guise of formal papers and informal presentations--are included. A large number of newspaper clippings provide an overview of the activities and achievements of both Green and the Southwest Chapter of MAS. Chapter activities are also documented in its newsletter, its annual reports, and its miscellaneous mailings.

 The collection contains virtually nothing on Green's life to 1932, thus omitting his work on the Franz Green Mound. From 1932 through 1939 only scattered portions of correspondence exist. Documentation is substantial, though still not complete, for the years 1940 through 1967; in places letters are obviously missing from the correspondence file, no draft exists of Green's 1961 paper, ""An Adena-type Gorget in Michigan,"" and neither his filmstrip nor a final draft of the narrative for it is extant. Neither Green's large artifact collection nor his library is represented. The collection contains virtually nothing about his farming activities or his family.

 The Amos Green Papers have been arranged into nine series: Biographical and Personal, Correspondence, Publications and Presentations, Archeological Fieldwork: Site Notes and Reports, Research, Maps, MAS Southwest Chapter, and Photographs.","Amos Green was by trade a farmer. He also raised and sold flowers for a time and earned money by selling agricultural supplies for the Dekalb Agricultural Association, Inc. in and around Berrien County, Michigan. But Green's passion in life was archaeology and local history. To read his correspondence one would think he was a professional archeologist, for farming receives only an occasional and passing reference; he remained, however, highly conscious that he was an amateur. Though with only a high school degree, he immersed himself in the literature of archaeology, paleontology, geology, and anthropology. He threw himself, too, into the practice of archaeology, excavating burial mounds and surveying construction sites. Green was also a leader in the reconstitution and growth of the Michigan Archeological Society (MAS), an organization that brought amateur and professional together. Green early earned the respect of the professionals with whom he worked; he published papers in prestigious journals and he corresponded regularly and familiarly with the professors at the University of Michigan museums of paleontology, archaeology, and anthropology. In addition, Green earned the esteem of his community, for much of his energy went into outreach programs to encourage farmers and other citizens to be more aware of and take an active interest in the history and prehistory of Berrien County.

 Green began his archeological work in 1913 when, with Harvey Franz, he excavated the Franz Green Mound in Porter County, Indiana. Service in World War I and the care of his farm and ailing mother apparently kept his other activities to a minimum until the 1940s, when he returned to the field for several excavations.

 In 1946 the Michigan Academy for Sciences, Letters, and the Arts published one of his papers, ""The Bevel in Steel and Stone Tools,"" which he had presented at an earlier Academy meeting. Among his more important ""professional"" activities in the following years were the presentation of papers at the 1952 meeting of the Central States Anthropological Society and at the 1956 meeting of the American Archeological Society, the supervision of the excavation of the Horseshoe Ditch at Sumnerville in 1954 and an archeological survey of a portion of the Muskegon Pipeline in 1957, the preparation of an educational filmstrip to be distributed through MAS in 1958. After helping to revive the MAS in 1950, Green served for eight years as president of the Southwest Chapter, and for 17 years on the executive board of MAS central. In Berrien County, he was the unofficial contact person for citizens who made archeological finds (the most important of which was the ""Prillwitz"" Mammoth in 1962), wrote newspaper articles and gave talks on local archaeology and history, and successfully promoted the marking of historic sites. For example, during the 1960s he created a series of short radio programs on the early history of Ft. St. Joseph, gave radio interviews on the early culture of Michigan's native Americans, and successfully promoted the marking of the site of a French Jesuit mission in Berrien Springs.

 Green never married. He remained active until he was mortally injured in a car accident in May of 1968. He died on July 18, 1968, at the age of 81.",6270; 6667; 6130; 8117; 3886; 4405; 4406; 4407,Anthropology.; Archaeology.; Indians of North America; Michigan; Archaeology.; Fossils.; Indian weapons; Mills,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3142,Photographs.,aat,1579; 1491; 1390; 1180; 317,Berrien County (Mich.); Berrien Springs (Mich.); Cass County (Mich.); Niles (Mich.); Sumnerville (Mich.),lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm,2757; 2757; 4679; 5795; 7708; 263,"Green, Amos R., 1887-1968; Green, Amos R., 1887-1968; Fitting, James Edward.; Greenman, Emerson Frank, 1895-1973; Hibbard, James.; Witthoft, John.",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,650; 973,Michigan Archaeological Society.; University of Michigan.

It is divided into four series: Family Background and Documents, University of Michigan, Correspondence, Photographs. The bulk of the collection occurs from 1910 to 1955 and features correspondence with various friends and family members; a large portion of the letters has been organized by correspondent and/or the correspondent's family, and the remainder is sorted chronologically.","Camilla Blanche Gillett was born on April 11, 1870 and married Frank Albert Green on December 19, 1886. The couple divorced in 1893 with one daughter, Ethel Margaret Green, born on October 25, 1889. Mother and daughter continued to live primarily in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area and remained extremely close during their lifetimes. Note that Camilla is sometimes referred to as ""Millie Gillett"", and she will frequently sign her letters ""Kim"", especially when sent to Ethel. Ethel is occasionally referred to by her middle name, Margaret.

 Camilla served as the Secretary of the Department of Engineering at the University of Michigan from 1907 to 1942. In that time, she helped to establish the Business and Professional Women's Society and played an active role helping students, especially the female engineers. As a result, Camilla became a mother-figure to them, so much that many came to address her as ""Mother"", ""Mama"" and other salutations of endearment. Select students were among the more frequent correspondents with both Camilla and Ethel. In addition, during the 1930s, Camilla aided then-retired Dean Mortimer Cooley in a compilation of the history of the University of Michigan.

 Ethel spent some time as a teacher, but also traveled and stayed with friends and relatives in and around Michigan. Late in her life, Ethel befriended Russell and Melva Bidlack, a former professor who served as the first Dean of the University of Michigan School of Information (then called the School of Library Science). Upon Ethel's death, this collection of papers was bequeathed to Russell Bidlack with the recommendation that they be donated to the Michigan Historical Collections at the Bentley Historical Library.

 Both Camilla and Ethel were beloved members of their community. However, both suffered frequent illnesses during their lifetime. Camilla eventually passed away after one of these sicknesses in 1955.

He originally entered the University of Michigan in 1916 as a student in the College of Engineering, but left when he was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1918. Greenman returned to Michigan in 1920, but this time as a student in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. Studying under Wilbert Hinsdale, from whom he gained a particular appreciation for Michigan archaeology, and Alexander Ruthven, he received his A.B. in 1923.

 From 1923 to 1924, Greenman attended Oxford University, receiving a diploma in anthropology. He also studied with the American School of Prehistoric Research in Europe in 1924. He then returned to the University of Michigan in the fall of 1924 to pursue doctoral studies in anthropology. He received his Ph.D. in 1927.

 Though he was appointed as Curator of the Great Lakes Division of the Museum of Anthropology in 1927, Greenman choose to leave in April 1928 to take a position as the Curator of Archaeology at the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society. He remained there for seven years, during which time he directed excavations at a number of Woodland sites, including the Seip Mound, as well as at the Reeve, Tuttle Hill, and South Park Sites.

 Greenman returned to the University of Michigan again in 1935 as a Research Associate in the Museum of Anthropology, a position he held for two years. Greenman was then promoted to Assistant Curator in 1937, Associate Curator in 1942, and Curator in 1945. Greenman held this position until his retirement in 1965. Greenman also taught in the Department of Anthropology, appointed as an Associate Professor in 1946 and promoted to Professor in 1965.

 Greenman was an active field archaeologist, conducting excavations at many sites around the Great Lakes and publishing the results. His largest research program was the excavation of sites in the Manitoulin District of Ontario, Canada. Greenman led a field school in the area from 1938 to 1953. He also led major excavations at the Younge Site in 1935, and the Riviere aux Vase, Wolf and Furton Sites in 1936 and 1937. Greenman's major publications included <title render=""italic"">The Younge Site: An Archaeological Record for Michigan</title> (Museum of Anthropology <title render=""italic"">Occasional Contribution</title> no. 6, 1937), <title render=""italic"">Guide to Serpent Mound</title> (Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society, 1939) and <title render=""italic"">The Indians of Michigan</title> (Michigan Historical Commission, 1961). Late in his career, Greenman became very interested in drawing connections between the Solutrean, an Upper Paleolithic culture of Europe, and the early cultures of the New World, publishing his hypotheses and findings in <title render=""italic"">Current Anthropology</title> in 1963.

 Greenman did much to foster cooperation between professional and amateur archaeologists in Michigan. He was the first secretary-treasurer of the Michigan Archaeological Society (MAS), a position he held from 1950 until 1955 when he was named Honorary Secretary. He was also the first editor of <title render=""italic"">Michigan Archaeologist</title>, guiding the journal from 1953 through 1965.

In his long, productive, and highly distinguished career spanning nearly seven decades, he played a pivotal role in transforming American archaeology into a fully scientific discipline.

 James B. Griffin was born in Atchison, Kansas on January 12, 1905. His father's occupation as a railroad man moved his family from Kansas to Denver to Oak Park, Illinois during Griffin's childhood. Griffin entered the University of Chicago in 1923 for undergraduate study. He initially pursued a course in business administration, then law, but eventually settled on a social science major. His studies exposed him to introductory anthropology and ethnology courses, including one taught by Fay-Cooper Cole, and engendered a lifelong fascination with human origins and cultural development.

 Griffin received his bachelor's degree from Chicago in 1927, but with his father ill and his family in need of financial support, he decided to enter a training program to become a junior executive for Standard Oil of Indiana. He manned service stations in the Chicago area for about a year and a half, but quickly lost interest in a career in business. In 1928, Griffin abandoned business permanently and returned to the University of Chicago to pursue a master's degree in anthropology under Cole. While in the master's program, Griffin took courses and participated in his first archaeological fieldwork through excavations at various sites in Illinois, deciding that archaeology rather than other areas of anthropology was his particular area of interest and would serve as the basis for his further study.

 Griffin received his master's degree in 1930, then was hired in the summer of 1931 to direct excavations at Athens, Pennsylvania for the Tioga Point Museum under a grant from the National Research Council. He planned to return to Pennsylvania the following year to excavate near Wilkes-Barre, but funding for the project was canceled. In late 1932, Cole put Griffin forward for a fellowship in Aboriginal North American Ceramics administered by the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan with financial support from philanthropist Eli Lilly. The museum's director, Carl Guthe, selected Griffin for the fellowship and he began his pursuit of a doctoral degree in anthropology at Michigan in 1933. Griffin would spend the next fifty years at the university in one role or another.

 Griffin's fellowship and work with the Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States formed the basis for his Ph.D. thesis (completed in 1936) and many of his early publications. The most significant of these was <title render=""italic"">The Fort Ancient Aspect</title>, published by the University of Michigan Press in 1943. Griffin also served as the editor for the important survey publication, <title render=""italic"">Archaeology of Eastern United States</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1952), a festschrift for his mentor, Fay-Cooper Cole.

 Griffin worked his way up through the ranks of the Museum of Anthropology, progressing from Research Associate to Assistant Curator to Associate Curator to Curator from 1936 to 1945. In late 1943 Carl Guthe resigned as director of the museum and recommended that Griffin be appointed as his successor. Administrative conflicts stalled the appointment for several years, but he was finally approved by the Regents as the museum's director in 1946. Griffin held this position until his retirement in 1975.

 In addition to his work at the museum, Griffin was also very active in the university's Department of Anthropology. He was named Associate Professor in 1945 and promoted to Professor in 1949. He chaired the dissertation committees for more than 40 doctoral students and was an active teacher and advisor. He also served as the department's chair from 1972 to 1975.

 Griffin participated in many important initiatives outside the University of Michigan. From 1940 to 1946 (with a break during the war years), Griffin, along with James Ford of Louisiana State and Philip Phillips of Harvard, organized and led the Lower Mississippi Valley Survey. The survey marked one of the first instances of significant inter-institutional cooperation in North American archaeology. Griffin continued his work in the area with the Central Mississippi Valley Archaeological Survey (C.M.V.A.S.), the Cahokia excavations, and the FAI-270 Archaeological Mitigation project.

 Griffin was not primarily a field archaeologist, however. His passion and expertise lay in making connections and surmising relationships between different artifacts, geographic areas, sites, and cultures. He was known for his piercing intellect, encyclopedic memory and vast knowledge of the prehistory of North America, externalized in his extensive index cards and pictorial files of ceramics and artifacts. He visited sites throughout the country to collect information and was widely consulted by professional and amateur archaeologists on an array of topics. Throughout his career, Griffin published his own work prolifically, and often reviewed the work of others.

 While his primary interest lay in the archaeology of North America, Griffin had many other interests. He traveled extensively, including a year-long study tour of Western Europe from 1953 to 1954 and a research trip to Soviet Russia in 1961, and was involved in initiating some of the earliest field projects for American graduate students behind the ""Iron Curtain"" in Poland and the former Yugoslavia. Griffin also participated in many regional, national, and international professional organizations, including terms on the leadership boards of the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS), the American Anthropological Association (AAA), and the Council on Michigan Archaeology (COMA), among others.

 Griffin was a pioneer in the development and use of several tools for the scientific analysis of archaeological specimens. Along with H.R. Crane of the university's Department of Physics, Griffin founded and provided oversight for the Radiocarbon Laboratory, in operation at Michigan from 1949 to 1970. The Radiocarbon Laboratory and its program of C-14 dating of specimens was the second of its kind in the United States. In the 1960s, Griffin collaborated with Michigan chemist Adon Gordus in the use of neutron activation analysis for sourcing obsidian, one of the most important analytical tools available to archaeologists for the study of prehistoric exchange. Griffin was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1968 for his innovative scientific work.

 After Griffin retired in 1975, he spent a number of years in Ann Arbor as a Research Scientist of the Museum of Anthropology. He then moved to Washington, D.C. in 1984 to serve as a Research Associate of the Smithsonian Institution. He continued to be active in the field of archaeology almost to the very end of his life, attending professional conferences, contributing to publications, and serving as an official or unofficial advisor to scores of younger archaeologists.

 Griffin married Ruby Fletcher on February 14, 1936. They were married for over forty years, until her death in 1979. Together they had three sons, John, David, and James. Griffin met his second wife, Mary Marsh DeWitt, while living in Washington. They were together for twelve years, until his death on May 31, 1997, at age 92.

Hinsdale Papers consist of five series: Personal, Correspondence, Topical Files, Writing and Michigan Site Files.","Wilbert B. Hinsdale was born on May 25, 1851 in Wadsworth, Ohio. He received a B.S. from Hiram College in 1875 and an M.S. in 1878. Hinsdale received an M.D. from Cleveland Homeopathic Medical College in 1887. He received an A.M. from Hiram College in 1897. Hinsdale served on the staff of the Cleveland Homeopathic Medical College from 1890 to 1895.

 In 1895 Hinsdale was appointed Professor of Materia Medica, Therapeutics, and Clinical Medicine (later Internal Medicine) and dean of the Homeopathic Medical College at the University of Michigan. He was later given the additional title of director of the Homeopathic Medical Hospital. He retired from both positions in 1922, after the college was essentially dissolved by a mandated merger with the university's Medical School.

 Although he was a doctor by profession, Hinsdale had a lifelong interest in archaeology, and even before the Museum of Anthropology was established, he deposited a large collection of Native American artifacts with the university. Soon after his retirement in 1922, Hinsdale was given the honorary title of custodian in charge of the collections in Michigan Archaeology. His charge was to develop the university's collections with funding from the Museum of Zoology. After the Museum of Anthropology was established, Hinsdale's title was changed to Associate in Charge of the Great Lakes Division in 1931.

 Affectionately termed the father of Michigan archaeology by his colleagues, Hinsdale was responsible for the first systematic attempts to identify, organize and record the prehistory of the state of Michigan. His extensive network of ""informants"" (mainly amateur archaeologists) provided him with a continual stream of information about archaeological sites and finds across the state. Hinsdale also visited many sites and led the earliest Museum of Anthropology-sponsored fieldwork in the state. Hinsdale's <title render=""italic"">Archaeological Atlas of Michigan</title>, published in 1931, brought together information about the location of Michigan sites throughout the state for the first time, and was an important resource for professional and amateur archaeologists alike. Other notable archaeological publications include <title render=""italic"">The First People of Michigan</title> (G. Wahr, 1930), <title render=""italic"">The Indians of Washtenaw County, Michigan</title> (G. Wahr, ca. 1927) and <title render=""italic"">Distribution of the Aboriginal Population of Michigan</title> (University of Michigan Press, 1932). Hinsdale was also involved in the development of two important anthropological associations in the state, the Michigan Archaeological Society and the Anthropology Section of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts and Letters.

 Hinsdale married Estella Stone in 1875. They had one son, Albert. Hinsdale's brother, Burke Aaron Hinsdale (1837-1900) was a well-known educator. Burke Hinsdale served as the president of Hiram College, was a professor in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan, wrote one of the earliest histories of the university, and was a personal friend of U.S. President James A. Garfield. Wilbert Hinsdale died on July 25, 1944 in Ann Arbor.

Photoprints and copy negatives, chiefly a portfolio entitled ""Man's Presence,"" a study of Michigan's manmade environment.",The finding aid is written in English,"Representing but a tiny fraction of Korab's oeuvre, the collection held at the Bentley Library will nevertheless appeal to a broad range of researchers. Especially in a collective sense, Korab photographs are not only about architecture and architectural photography, but also about art, technology, modernism, photography's history, the environment, urbanism, ruralism, and the creative process itself. They also document one individual's spirited commitment to a life's work -- work expressed both analytically and emotionally.

 The essence of the collection is a Korab portfolio entitled <title render=""italic"">Man's Presence</title>, a study of Michigan's man-made environment that drew him to dozens of towns, cities and rural areas in the upper and lower peninsulas. Photographs capture the quiet magnificence of silos and barns, the elegance of 19th century mansions, the utilitarian architecture of iron foundries and grain elevators. There are also pictures depicting ways man has wasted resources (an abandoned lumber mill, a barren tract of bulldozed land. A superb example of Korab's lifelong fascination with vernacular architecture, <title render=""italic"">Man's Presence</title> is a deliberate effort to capture on film Michigan worlds that otherwise might go unnoticed or become lost to future generations.

 The collection is comprised of three series: Biographical Materials; Man's Presence Contact Sheets; and Man's Presence Copy Prints and Copy Negatives.","Architectural photographer Balthazar Korab was born in Hungary on February 16, 1926. A student of architecture when he left Budapest in 1949, he completed his studies at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris in 1955. Also while still in Europe, he studied art history in Paris, urbanism in Venice, and worked with Le Corbusier. Emigrating to the United States in 1955, Korab joined Eero Saarinen's firm in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Saarinen was innovatively making use of large scale models as a way for designers to better understand ""the wholeness"" of a project. In this environment, which was devoted to the architectural application of new technologies, Korab introduced photography to the studio as a principal tool in the process of design. A year later, however, he quit the firm when he was denied entrance into an international competition for Australia's Sydney Opera House because Saarinen was on the jury. Turning to professional picture-making in order to earn a living, he flourished almost immediately, and established his own studio in Troy, Michigan in the same year. Interpreting and documenting architecture through photography became his passion and his life's work.

 From the start, Korab had a unique gift for integrating photographic possibilities and architectural sensibilities with architectural documentation. ""To record architecture,"" he once said, ""is to service the architect. To interpret architecture, one has to dig deeper to the essence of the idea and project it onto an image.""[1] There is distinction and depth of vision evident early on in Korab's photographic representations of the architecture of most of the legendary designers of the modern era. His client list includes Mies van der Rohe, Louis Sullivan, Minoru Yamasaki, and Frank Lloyd Wright. He has photographed work from the offices of Gunnar Birkerts &amp; Associates, Frank O. Gehry, Albert Kahn Associates, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, I.M. Pei, and for the pages of <title render=""italic"">Progressive Architecture</title>, <title render=""italic"">Architectural Record</title>, <title render=""italic"">National Geographic</title>, <title render=""italic"">Fortune</title>, and <title render=""italic"">Architectural Digest</title>, to name but a handful.

 It is important to make the distinction that Korab is an architect who takes photographs, not simply a photographer who is knowledgeable about architecture. Architectural photography for him goes well beyond the representation of buildings. ""For me,"" he once said, ""the built environment, architecture, is of prime interest and not just a pretext, a subject of esthetic considerations ... Aesthetics, however, lend power to the message I am to convey."" Korab's prime concern is to interpret the building, to understand its soul or purpose. These interests translate into striking and memorable images, not only of modern and contemporary structures by world-renowned architects, but of regional, vernacular, and folk traditions, another lifelong enthusiasm. With a reputation that spans continents, Korab spends much of his time traveling the world on assignment, and has combined an ongoing interest in native architecture with his travels, searching worldwide for historic ""high and low examples (sophisticated and vernacular, urban and rural.[2]

 His study of Michigan, for example, entitled ""Man's Presence,"" focuses broadly on the man-made environment and includes images depicting the way ""man changes the environment for better or worse. He lives in a place, he works, he builds, he exploits, he improves, he destroys. It's all there."" [3] Korab produced more than 5,000 photographs of the towns, cities, and rural areas in the upper and lower peninsulas, driven by the belief that, ""You cannot really save the buildings, but ... the next best thing is to go there with an educated eye and record them so that when they are destroyed, they will be remembered.""

 Korab's talent was early recognized and celebrated by the American Institute of Architects in 1964, when he was awarded the AIA Medal for Photography of Architecture. In 1986, he was the first photographer ever to receive the Arts Foundation of Michigan award. His work has been widely exhibited, collected and published. Publications include <title render=""italic"">Saarinen House</title> (1995); <title render=""italic"">Encyclopedia of American Architecture</title> (1994); <title render=""italic"">Columbus, Indiana</title> (1988); <title render=""italic"">Michigan: a Photo Essay</title> (1987); <title render=""italic"">Roofscapes of Rome: an Urban Thesis</title> (1976); and <title render=""italic"">Archabet: An Architectural Alphabet</title> (1985).

 In 1997 Korab was selected to give the first Michigan Honors Lecture, which was jointly sponsored by University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban Design, the American Institute of Architects Huron Valley, and the Michigan Architectural Foundation. For an exhibit accompanying the event entitled <title render=""italic"">Balthazar Korab, 40 /40</title>, forty images executed over forty years were mounted, including examples from a large collection of the work of Frank Lloyd Wright; images culled from years of photographing Cranbrook in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; selections from the commissioned photographs of Mies van der Rohe's later works; and photographs of many of the classic buildings of the modern age. One of the highlights was a portfolio of twelve photographs presented as an official gift to Hungarian President Arpad Goncz by President Clinton while on a state visit to Hungary in 1994. Also included on the walls of the exhibit were examples of the vernacular Korab continues to document while traveling the world.

The collection has been divided into the following series: Correspondence; Photographs; Personal/Miscellaneous; Gogebic Industrial Bureau Files; Research Files; Collected Materials; and Writings/Speeches.","Victor F. Lemmer was born in Escanaba, Michigan June 18, 1898, the son of immigrant parents from Luxembourg. Following his high school education, Lemmer worked as a country school teacher and as a bookkeeper with the William Bonifas Lumber Company. He then attended and graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1926. After graduation he returned to the Bonifas Company, first at Escanaba and later at Marenisco. In 1929, he moved to Ironwood where he established an insurance business and where he resided for the rest of his life.

 Through much of the 1930s, Lemmer worked as a bookkeeper and served in local government positions. In 1931 he became Gogebic County auditor, serving until 1939. In 1939, the mining companies of the area formed the Gogebic Industrial Bureau which was established as a taxpayers association. Because of his knowledge of the area and overall competence, Lemmer was chosen secretary of the organization and serving as public relations representative for the industry. Also in 1939 and with the approval of the Gogebic Industrial Bureau, Lemmer was chosen to serve on a temporary and part-time basis as coordinator of the state social welfare commission charged with the implementation of Michigan's new welfare and relief plan. Lemmer served briefly in Lansing then returned to Ironwood.

Researchers should note that this collection contains depictions of the lives and cultures of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Bodewadami Nations in Michigan (among other Indigenous cultures across North America) in an archaeological context, described by primarily white archaeologists. As such, materials in this collection may contain offensive language and descriptions of those cultures.","The Michigan Archaeological Society (MAS) is an amateur association concerned with the cultures, artifacts, and peoples of early Michigan. It was officially incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1954. The origins of the MAS, however, go back to 1924, when a group of professional and amateur archaeologists decided that ""a united effort was necessary to assemble the data at hand and further search for additional evidence of man's early occupancy in Michigan"" (Box 1, Background folder). Unfortunately, the beginning of the Depression meant the end of the fledgling MAS at the time.

 Although many MAS members continued their interest in, and commitment to, archaeology, working in small, informal groups, the MAS was not rejuvenated until 1950. It was Emerson F. Greenman, of the University of Michigan's Museum of Anthropology, who reorganized the Society, following the tradition of close ties between professionals and amateurs. Within the MAS, both professionals and amateurs pursued the same goals: ""to investigate, research, record, and conserve archaeological sites and artifacts; to cooperate with universities, colleges, and museums with similar interests; and to exchange and disseminate information on such subjects"" (Box 1, Background folder).

 Over the years, the MAS has been involved in several projects ranging from highway salvage to site surveys to the preservation of petroglyphs. In the process, they have dealt and cooperated with numerous state agencies, museums, colleges, as well as peer archaeological groups in Michigan and other states.

 The MAS operates as a statewide ""umbrella"" organization made up of local chapters in various Michigan cities. Chapters currently, or at one time, associated with the Michigan Archaeological Society include Blue Ridge Chapter, Central Michigan Chapter, Clinton Valley Chapter, Genesee Chapter, Kalamazoo Chapter, Little Forks Chapter, Newaygo Chapter, River Raisin Chapter (Monroe), Saginaw Chapter, South Central Chapter, Southeastern Chapter, Southwest Chapter, Upper Grand Valley Chapter, Upper Peninsula Chapter, and Wright L.

Bulk of the materials are 19th century stereographs and photographs. Main subjects are mining operations, natural scenery, and communities, including those of the Ojibwe. Also includes 20th century maps, drawings, and reports related to mining and utility companies.",The finding aid is written in English,"The collection consists of 19th and early 20th centuries visual materials (drawing, maps, photographs, postcards, and stereographs) collected by John P. Murphy. The majority of the collection documents life in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with northern Wisconsin, northern Minnesota, and the bordering regions of Canada also represented. The bulk of the collection is composed of over 800 stereographs and 300 photographs that date from 1860-1940. The prevalent photographers in the collection, of the photographic materials with attributions, are B. F. Childs, W. J. Bell, Charles A. Zimmerman, and W. Wells Lamb.

Broadly, the photographic materials in the collection have three main subjects, the first of which is mining and lumber industries, including images of workers. Iron mines in Gogebic and Marquette Counties, Michigan as well as copper mines in Houghton County, Michigan account for the majority of this subject. Another main subject is views of surrounding communities, including those of the Ojibwe (sometimes anglicized as Chippewa), supplemented with portraits and scenes of domestic life. Additional communities with strong representation include Ironwood, Mackinac, and Marquette in Michigan as well as Duluth, Minnesota. Furthermore, this collection includes views of the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Additionally, views of natural scenery; including rivers, rock formations, and waterfalls, are present. Specifically, the Mackinac Island, Michigan; Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore; Keweenaw County, Michigan; and North Shore of Lake Superior regions are well-represented. A small selection of items related to the Murphy family is also included in the photographic materials of the collection. 

The collection also includes maps, drawings, reports, and volumes dating from 1900-1950 that pertain to mining and utility companies in the Lake Superior region. The majority of these materials are attributed to either the White Pine Copper Company or the Oliver Iron Mining Company. 

Researchers should note that the collection includes materials depicting Anishnaabe peoples, families, homes, and culture from a white colonial lens. It also includes images of the Lakota peoples. For more information about language and perspective in the collection, please see the processing note.  ","
The Straits of Mackinac separate Michigan’s Upper and Lower Peninsulas, and in the seventeenth century Anishinaabe peoples were the primary inhabitants of the lands along both shores. With the arrival of the French in the late 1600s, followed by the British, the fur trade became a major element of the region’s economy, centered at Mackinac. After the American Revolution, the Upper Peninsula and the southern shore of Lake Superior was nominally ceded to the newly established United States. In 1837, the former was granted to the newly formed state of Michigan by the federal government. Over the following decades, the discovery of copper and iron deposits in the region spurred the development of enormous mining operations while its forests supported a sizeable lumber industry. The demand for labor by these industries in turn lured white settlers to the area, as well as sparking the growth of cities along Lake Superior.

The growth of the mining and lumber industries created railroads and shipping lines to support them, making visiting the region considerably easier. But even before these developments, the Upper Peninsula had attracted white American visitors, eager to view the region’s natural beauty. Mackinac Island was already hosting both American and international tourists in the 1840s and the first of its famous hotels opened in 1852. With the spread of the railroad and steamship lines, their numbers swelled in the years after the Civil War.

Along with these tourists came white commercial photographers. Their pictures were primarily destined for sale to European-Americans, to provide memories of visits to the Lake Superior region and to share with friends and family on their return home. That market dictated the tenor and content of many of their photographs which captured the communities, industries, and landscapes around the Lake. Over 1,100 of those photographs make up this collection.

One of the earliest and most influential photographers of Lake Superior was Brainard Freemont Childs, who has 197 images included in this collection. A white man born in Vermont, Childs became interested in photography while serving in the Union Army. He came to Michigan in 1869 and in the early 1870s circumnavigated Lake Superior in a small sailboat photographing everything of interest and creating the extended stereoscopic series, ""Gems of Lake Superior Scenery."" Opening a gallery in Marquette, within a few years he was wholesaling images to other photographers across the country. Many of his images were published on either his own mounts or those of fellow white photographer Christian Brubaker of Houghton, to whom Childs sold many of his negatives.

Childs’ photographs captured what became the archetypal images of the Upper Peninsula—the Pictured Rocks, Sault Ste. Marie, Mackinac Island, lumber camps, and the iron and copper mines. But Childs also took numerous photographs of Native Americans presented—often explicitly—as part of the ""Lake Superior Scenery."" Such characterizations were part of a broader transition of depictions of Native Americans in American culture during the last decades of the nineteenth century. In the earlier years of America’s westward expansion, popular subjects for Native American photography were images of ""renegade"" and ""hostile"" Indian warriors and leaders that contributed to and reinforced racist views of Native Americans. But in the wake of the Indian Wars of the 1870s and the formal closing of the frontier, photographic representations of Native Americans changed; the emphasis on savagery shifted to a focus on depictions of a noble but supposedly vanishing people. These broader developments shaped the 104 photographs of Native Americans in this collection taken by Childs and others, as did the fact that their creation was inextricably intertwined with larger processes of racism and U.S. colonialism.

Twenty-four of Childs’ photographs in the Murphy Collection depict Native Americans and like the majority of the Native Americans who were captured by the photographer’s lens in the lands touching Lake Superior they are members of the Ojibway people. Members of the Anishinaabe culture, according to their oral traditions at some time in the distant past the Ojibway resided on the Atlantic seaboard. In a journey that lasted generations, they, along with the Odawa and Bodewadami peoples, made their way westward. At the Straits of Mackinac, they separated; the Odawa remained at the strait, the Ojibway migrated north and west towards Lake Superior, and the Bodewadami moved down the eastern shore of Lake Michigan.

Over the course of the following centuries, the Ojibway settled throughout the Upper Peninsula, as well as in the northern areas of modern Wisconsin and Minnesota. In a series of unequal treaties with the United States government beginning in 1820, the Ojibway were forced to relinquish nearly all their historical lands. As American settlements expanded in the region, the terms of these treaties were increasingly violated or outright discarded. In 1853, for example, the Ojibway lands at Sault Ste. Marie guaranteed by treaty were seized for construction of the Soo Locks. By mid-century, the Ojibway were increasingly unable to sustain themselves by traditional means, and many men found work in the mines or for lumber companies. Yet despite the multifaceted assault on their culture and traditions, the loss of lands, and the ever-increasing encroachment of American settlers, the Ojibway were broadly successful in maintaining their language, social systems, political integrity, and religious values until the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Then in the 1880s a program of ethnocide was inaugurated by the federal government that had a profound impact on Michigan’s Anishinaabe. In 1887 a boarding school system was created at Baraga, Harbor Springs, and Mount Pleasant, operating under the principle ""kill the Indian, save the man."" Over the course of decades, hundreds of Native American children were separated from their families and spent years at these schools, with many dying at them. Congress also passed the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887 which ended the reservation system and converted traditional systems of land tenure into a government-imposed system of private property. This proved devastating to many tribal societies including the Ojibway. By the final years of the nineteenth century most were living in poverty, frequently on the margins of white American society, struggling to survive in the timber or mining industries or by whatever other means was available. It is these broader processes that shaped the lives and depictions of the Ojibway photographed by Childs and his contemporaries in this collection.

Although Ojibway communities from throughout the Lake Superior region are represented in this collection, those living around Sault Ste. Marie appear most frequently. This was primarily due to the Soo Locks, connecting Lake Superior with the Lower Great Lakes, that brought large numbers of travelers and tourists through the city. Images taken by Childs in the 1870s and then later by William J. Bell, another white photographer, in the 1880s and 1890s capture the changes in both the Locks and the lives of the Native Americans living near them over the final decades of the nineteenth century.

The Ojibway photographed frequently had little choice in the matter of when or how they were depicted. That is not to say, however, that they exercised no agency in their photographs. Some sought out photographers and sold their likenesses to an eager public. Others were convinced to pose, often aided by a small gift or payment. The ""Rapids Pilot"" (B2-24) depicts John Boucher, an Ojibway who made a living carrying tourists through the Sault rapids and was something of a celebrity and may be an example of a willing subject. In other images, the array of complex motivations and circumstances may be glimpsed in the body language and expressions of those being photographed—a direct gaze into the camera or a turn away from the photographer—often appear in the same picture.

Processes of colonialism are also evident in the way photographs of Native Americans were captioned. Rather than captioned with individuals’ Anishinaabe names, they were labelled in terms that middle class white American consumers were familiar with. For example, (B2-20) depicts an elderly Ojibway woman who is described as ""Old Nokomis"" after the character in Henry Longfellow’s <i>The Song of Hiawatha</i>. Similarly, a photo (B2-22) of a group of Ojibway women and children is entitled ""An Aboriginal Sorosis,"" a mocking comparison with Sorosis, the first professional women's club in the United States founded in 1868. Even in “natural” photographs such issues emerge, as in (1.040) which depicts what is likely ""Skull Cave"" on Mackinac Island taken by white photographer James A. Jenney of Flint. The location is a sacred site for the Anishinaabe, a place for burials and worship, which was seen as a curiosity and tourist attraction by white visitors.

While the Upper Peninsula was a particularly popular source of photographs, the lands of Wisconsin and Minnesota were also captured by enterprising white photographers. Among the most famous of those whose work is present in the collection are the closely linked trio of Benjamin Upton, Joel Whitney, and Charles Zimmerman of St. Paul Minnesota in the 1860s and 1870s. In addition to the lumber industry and views of Lake Superior in this collection, the three men also photographed Native Americans. Zimmerman took numerous images of Ojibwa, including direct depictions of colonialism in a series of photographs of ""Indian Payments"" at Odanah, Wisconsin. Among Upton’s most notable photographs in the collections are five images of the Métis, a people of mixed Ojibwa and French-Canadian descent, who were derisively captioned as ""Pembina Half-Breeds."" Also in the collection are six images of Santee Sioux taken by Upton in the aftermath of the 1862 Dakota War. After several months of fighting, most of the Santee surrendered to the U.S. government and thirty-eight were eventually executed in what remains the largest mass execution in U.S. history.  The collection also contains several dozen photographs taken in the early 1890s by William Wells Lamb, who had a special interest in the iron mines that straddled the Michigan-Wisconsin border.",4823; 4035; 3828; 3529; 4552; 3613; 4177; 3841; 4644; 3721; 4141; 3957; 3621; 4046; 4269; 4203; 17196; 4550; 3626; 4909; 4801; 4147; 17846; 8328; 6512,Accidents.; Boat and ship industry.; Buildings.; Camps.; Canals.; Canoes.; Carts and wagons.; Cemeteries.; Children and adults.; Construction.; Copper mining.; Dwellings.; Fires.; Fishing.; Forts and fortifications.; Hunting.; Indians of North America; Iron mining.; Lumber industry.; Mills.; Miners.; Mining.; Nature.; Ojibwa Indians.; Recreation.,lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh,3223; 3190; 3346; 3143; 3142; 3216; 3187; 3371,Digital file formats; Drawings.; Group portraits.; Maps.; Photographs.; Portraits.; Postcards.; Stereographs.,aat; aat; aat; aat; aat; aat; aat; aat,17836; 17837; 1053; 17838; 1022; 17839; 1932; 11771; 1564; 2163; 17840; 998; 1567; 17841; 950; 1000; 1936; 15573; 2100; 1499; 17842; 937; 1001; 17843; 1444; 17844; 17845,"Ashland County (Wis.); Bayfield County (Wis.); Calumet (Mich.); Cook County (Minn.); Delta County (Mich.); Duluth (Minn.); Gogebic County (Mich.); Gogebic Range (Mich. and Wis.); Houghton County (Mich.); Hurley (Wis.); Iron County (Wis.); Ironwood (Mich.); Keweenaw County (Mich.); Lake County (Minn.); Mackinac Island (Mich.); Marquette (Mich.); Marquette County (Mich.); Marquette Iron Range (Mich.); Ontonagon County (Mich.); Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (Mich.); Saint Louis County (Minn.); Sault Sainte Marie (Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie Canal (Mich.); Sault Ste.

For instance, postcards of the Irish Hills region can be found under that name as well as under the nearby towns of Brooklyn and Onsted.

 Outsize postcards are located in Box 12, and a few postcards too large for that box are located with the medium sized photographs in UCCm.",The collection has been assembled by the Michigan Historical Collections division of the Bentley Historical Library from a number of individual donors.,6823;

 The papers also include one folder of material on spring 1968 disturbances at Pioneer collected by Nicholas Schreiber, Allan Schreiber's father and principal of Pioneer High School in the 1960s.

 The papers contain the following series: Background and Planning, Correspondence, Merger, Evaluations, Reunion, Printed Material, School Logs, and Audiovisual Material.","Allan Schreiber, a teacher at Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, was part of an initiative in the 1970s to develop an alternative high school, known as Earthworks. The impetus for an alternative educational program partly stemmed from a period of social unrest during the late 1960s and early 1970s at Pioneer. Racial tensions as well as perceived threats to freedoms of expression and speech incited student protests and rioting. Perceiving a need for change, Ray Silverman, a teacher at Pioneer, proposed an alternative education program that would take place in the portable classrooms behind the high school, emphasizing student-led curriculum development and governance. At the time, Silverman's proposal was dismissed.

 The alternative high school concept took shape upon the arrival of new school superintendent, Bruce McPherson, who was a strong supporter of alternative education. In 1971, about sixty faculty and students at Pioneer proposed the idea of an alternative school, known as Pioneer Two. The school board approved and Pioneer Two began in October 1971 with an enrollment of 108 students. Schreiber, then a teacher at Pioneer, did not join the faculty of Pioneer Two until 1972, frustrated from the lack of interest that faculty at Pioneer had in making changes. Schreiber was immediately asked to head Pioneer Two.

 The educational experience at Pioneer Two aimed to go beyond the traditional classroom. Students were encouraged to propose their own educational curriculum. Students did not have graduation requirements and grading was on a pass/fail basis. The school also offered non-traditional classes and expanded students' education beyond the classroom, in the form of school field trips. The school was renamed Earthworks in 1972, inspired by a field trip to Indian mounds in southern Ohio.

 A decline in student enrollment and a lack of support from school administrators led to the decline of Earthworks in the mid-1970s. In 1978, administrators proposed that Earthworks be merged with Community High School, another alternative high school in Ann Arbor. In the fall of 1978 Earthworks became part of Community High School. Earthworks soon after fell out of existence as students and programs became part of the new high school. Schreiber left the Ann Arbor Public Schools after the first year that Earthworks merged with Community High.

 For a detailed history of Earthworks, researchers may want to consult Allan Schreiber's personal account of Earthworks' history written in 1988 (found in the first folder of the collection.)",9526; 9526; 5247; 3563; 4184; 4053,Alternative schools; Alternative schools; School field trips; Schools; Students; Teachers,lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3223; 3169; 3142; 3208,Digital file formats; Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Video recordings.,aat; aat; aat; aat,,,,7441; 7441; 7441; 7645,"Schreiber, Allan.; Schreiber, Allan.; Schreiber, Allan.; Schreiber, Nicholas.",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,1429; 3638; 1652; 1429,"Earthworks (School : Ann Arbor, Mich.); Community High School (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Mich.); Earthworks (School : Ann Arbor, Mich.)",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,,,

Spalding, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan businessman; correspondence, 1887-1901, of Edward Spalding, dental student at University of Michigan, later Detroit, Michigan dentist; and other family papers relating to business affairs, and conditions in the South before and after the Civil War; and photographs.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Spalding-Sexton Family collection consists of photocopies and microfilm of letters largely collected by Mrs. Miranda Sexton Spalding of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan (also of Ellington, Connecticut, Eutah, Alabama, and Ruffin, North Carolina). The collection is arranged chronologically. In the detailed contents list below, description is generally at the folder level, however, some letters of notable content have been highlighted with additional description. Also included are photographs.

  <emph render=""bold"">Scope and Content (by time period)</emph>

 In the pre-Civil War era, materials on the Sexton (nee Bartlett) family predominate. Connecticut-born merchants, teachers, farmers, and preachers, the correspondence reflects their activities mainly in Connecticut, Alabama, Texas, Illinois, and New York. It is particularly good on the problems of merchants in Alabama and on life in Texas. It contains comparisons of their new locations with their native Connecticut.

 Early Spalding (nee Paine) family material is concentrated around the death of Dr. Luther Spalding in 1825 and his estate. Thereafter, correspondence is sparse until about 1850, when Mary Spalding (Mrs. C.P. Chamberlain) becomes a regular correspondent. Her letters mainly concern family matters and life in New Lisbon, Ohio, and Canisteo, New York.

 During the antebellum period, the Collection includes scattered letters from William P. Spalding on business developments and social life at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and his travels through northern Wisconsin and Upper Peninsula Michigan mining areas and to New York City. The letters of his wife, Miranda Sexton Spalding, mainly deal with her early life as a student in Connecticut and as a teacher in Alabama.

 During the Civil War, the papers of William P. Spalding predominate. They concern the activities of the 27th Michigan Infantry and developments in Michigan, particularly at the Soo, in the Upper Peninsula mining areas, and in the Thumb. Included are the letters from William Spalding while in service, 1862-1864, and to him from his wife, children, business associates, and members and former members of the regiment (including William Childs letters on activities of the regiment, 1864-1865). Other Civil War soldier letters include those of Miranda Sexton Spalding's brothers: Edwin Sexton, a member of Company l, Delanos Calvary, 2nd Illinois Volunteers, 1861-1864, and John Sexton, a member of an Alabama regiment, Confederate States of America, 1863 (concerning his capture and incarceration by Union forces and the family in Alabama). There are also letters, 1860-1865), to Charles and Mary Sexton, the parents of Miranda Spalding, from friends and relatives in Connecticut about developments there.

 From 1866 through 1886, the collection becomes less extensive. It includes correspondence from Miranda Spalding about her life trying to run a plantation in Ruffin, North Carolina, 1869-1874, and from members of the Sexton family on their experiences in Alabama, Texas, and Illinois during and after the war.

 After 1886, the collection is almost totally dominated by the immediate family of William P. Spalding, particularly his son: Edward and his wife: Miranda. Edward's letters describe his life as a student at Michigan Normal College, 1887-1889, as a dental student at the University of Michigan, 1889-1892, and as a dentist in Detroit, 1892-1910. Miranda's epistles recount family affairs and life at the Soo. Scattered throughout the period is correspondence from another son, Eugene, on family matters and his medical practice in Luverne, Minnesota. After 1900, Adelle H. Spalding, second wife of son William, writes frequently concerning mining activities in Idaho and Alaska.

 Leslie A. White was born on January 19, 1900 in Salida, Colorado to Alvin Lincoln White, a Methodist minister, and Mildred May Millard White. His childhood was unstable, with many moves following his parents' divorce in 1905. After high school, White worked as a stenographer and bookkeeper in Louisiana until 1918 when he enlisted in the Navy. Following his discharge the following year, he studied at Louisiana State University. In 1921, he transferred to Columbia University where he received his A.B. in 1923 and his A.M. in psychology in 1924. He continued his education at the University of Chicago receiving his Ph.D. in sociology and anthropology in 1927.

 From 1927 to 1930, White taught at the University of Buffalo, then came to the University of Michigan where he remained from 1930 to 1970. He was promoted to full professor in 1943 and served as chairman of the department of anthropology from 1945 to 1957. Following his retirement from the U-M, White was a visiting professor at San Francisco State College and the University of California at Santa Barbara.

 White was extremely active as a teacher and researcher in his discipline. He made numerous field trips to the Keresan Pueblos and to the Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico between 1926 and 1957 and was leader of the Ethnological Field Party of the Laboratory of Anthropology, Sante Fe, New Mexico, to the Hopi pueblo of Oraibi in the summer of 1932. In addition, White was the author of many articles, monographs and books. Some of the most important monographs were on the Acoma, San Felipe, Santo Domingo, Santa Ana and Sia Pueblos. The books which best expressed his evolutionary and culturological theory and interpretation were The Science of Culture (1949) and The Evolution of Culture (1959). White was the leading scholar of the life and career of anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan, editing Morgan's travel journal and his Indian Journals, 1859-1862.

 White was visiting professor at a number of universities. Also professional active, he was president of the Central States Anthropological Society, president of the American Anthropological Association (1963-1964), and vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1958).",6270; 7953; 6806; 10822; 6428; 4357; 10823; 10824; 6270; 7953; 6806; 10822; 6428; 4357; 10823; 10824,Anthropology.; Nuclear energy.; Indians of North America.; Pueblo Indians.; Religion.; Anthropology.; Indians of North America; Kwakiutl Indians.; Anthropology.; Nuclear energy.; Indians of North America.; Pueblo Indians.; Religion.; Anthropology.; Indians of North America; Kwakiutl Indians.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh,3142; 3142,Photographs.; Photographs.,aat; aat,1329; 1329,Vancouver Island (B.C.); Vancouver Island (B.C.),lcsh; lcsh,4556; 8630; 3010; 6252; 4556; 4667; 4556; 483; 1423; 869; 5225; 7403; 1183; 4667; 4891; 7203; 734; 1666; 6905; 8947; 7617; 5006; 7783; 3229; 7771; 7252; 5546; 5688; 8055; 7635; 6424; 4066; 8739; 72; 2035; 3683; 5393; 1002; 8630; 3010; 6252; 4556; 4667; 4556; 483; 1423; 869; 5225; 7403; 1183; 4667; 4891; 7203; 734; 1666; 6905; 8947; 7617; 5006; 7783; 3229; 7771; 7252; 5546; 5688; 8055; 7635; 6424; 4066; 8739; 72; 2035; 3683; 5393; 1002,"White, Leslie A., 1900-1975; Goldenweiser, Alexander, 1880-1940; Humphrey, Norman Daymond.; Morgan, Lewis Henry, 1818-1881; White, Leslie A., 1900-1975; Boas, Franz, 1858-1942; White, Leslie A., 1900-1975; Adams, Randolph Greenfield, 1892-1951; Bain, Read, 1892-; Barnes, Harry Elmer, 1889-1968; Beard, Charles Austin, 1874-1948; Benedict, Ruth, 1887-1948; Berle, Adolf Augustus, 1895-1971; Boas, Franz, 1858-1942; Childe, V.

Most of the letters were received by Cannon or other members of his family. There is in these letters much documentation relating to the Upper Peninsula and to the history of the settlement of Macomb County. Of especial interest are those letters and documents relating to the border dispute between Wisconsin and Michigan (particularly in the period of the first decade of the 20th Century) arising out of a surveying error in the 1830s. Many of the letters are from Upper Peninsula businessman and University of Michigan Regent Peter White.

 Other items of interest are essays and lectures of the students who attended the Stony Creek Lyceum Rochester School where Cannon taught in the 1840s, a few Civil War letters from his brother Levi Cannon who served with Co. B of the 22nd Michigan Infantry, and essays Cannon wrote on his surveying mentor William A. Burt and on the early settlement of Macomb County.","George Cannon was born on December 30, 1826, in Day, New York, to Pearl and Mary Cannon. In 1833, the family moved to Michigan, first to Saline, in Washtenaw County, and then to Bruce, in Macomb County. As a young man, Cannon worked mornings and nights for his board, and, at the end of school-terms, for his teachers, to pay tuition. During the summer of 1846, he was part of an exploring party searching for minerals (primarily copper) in the Lake Superior region of the Upper Peninsula. In the summer of 1847 he explored the Ontonagon Range. After he returned from the Upper Peninsula in 1847, he attended the Academy at Rochester, in Oakland County, for two years, after which he spent four years teaching in the area.

 Cannon had developed an interest in exploration, and especially surveying while in the mineral region, and it continued throughout his life. In the spring of 1849, he was employed by Judge W.A. Burt, who had been Dr. Douglass Houghton's assistant, and later took over the task of completing Houghton's survey of the State. During 1849, Cannon surveyed the sub-divisional lines of ten townships. In August of 1849, he was appointed U.S. Deputy Surveyor, and completed nine contracts in that capacity, including the Grand Traverse region, many towns in the Cheboygan area, and the islands of Saginaw Bay. He also worked in the Upper Peninsula, and was appointed to examine the surveys in the relatively unexplored territory between Lakes Superior and Michigan, and the area between the Pictured Rocks and the meridian line. He also surveyed the township lines on the north shore of Lake Superior, near Pigeon River, in Minnesota. In 1852, he made surveys in the Grand Traverse region between Higgins Lake and Elk Rapids. During the winter of 1852-53 he surveyed the islands of Saginaw Bay. He then began a survey of public lands of the Upper Peninsula from the meridian at the ""Soo"" to the west for 108 miles.

 His final survey, in 1856, was the laying out of an extensive Indian reservation in Minnesota. Public survey work was discontinued the following year, and Cannon began his work examining and selecting pine and farmlands in Michigan and Wisconsin. He resided in Macomb County in the city of Washington, and held extensive lands in several areas of the State.

 In the 1890s, Cannon was active in both the Macomb County Historical Society and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society. One of his interests was the history of the disputed boundary line between Michigan and Wisconsin because of a surveying error.",6130; 6717,Indians of North America; Surveyors,lcsh; lcsh,3152,Diaries.,aat,1441; 1442; 1443; 939; 1444; 910,"Macomb County (Mich.); Michigan; Wisconsin; Upper Peninsula (Mich.); Superior, Lake.; United States",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,6553; 6849; 4532; 1489; 6775,"Cannon, George Henry, 1826-; Burt, William Austin, 1792-1858; Cannon, Levi H., 1830-; Crapo, Henry Howland, 1830-1920; White, Peter, 1830-1908",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,412,"United States.

Represented in the collection are letters to/from Elizabeth's parents Thomas and Margaret Evans Chandler; Margaret's sisters Ruth Evans and Jane Howell; Elizabeth's brothers Thomas and William, and William's wife Sarah Taylor Chandler. Following 1830, much of the correspondence of Elizabeth and Thomas Chandler and Ruth Evans is with family members in the East, Benjamin Lundy, and others, describing their settlement in Lenawee County, agricultural conditions, and local and national anti-slavery movements. Other correspondents in the collection include William Bliss, Darius Comstock, Isaac Crary, Abi Evans, Jane Howell, Darius C. Jackson, Benjamin Lundy, William M. Sullivan and Matthew F. Whittier.

 In all, there are twenty-two letters, 1830-1834, written to members of her family, from Elizabeth Margaret Chandler. The earliest letter, June 14, 1830, written from Philadelphia, discusses the advantages of emigrating to Michigan. The later letters are written from Hazelbank, a farm in Lenawee County, between Adrian and Tecumseh, where Elizabeth Chandler settled with her brother, Thomas Chandler, and her aunt, Ruth Evans. The letters describe the clearing of the land, the building of a log cabin and its furnishings, the planting of the first crops, and give an account of the district around the farm, its settlers (chiefly Quakers), its trade and agriculture, land and commodity prices. They contain scattered references to abolitionist activities, such as the boycott of slave-produced commodities, to the Black Hawk War in Illinois and Wisconsin, 1832, and to other current events. Fifteen letters, 1830-1835, on the same subjects, were written by Thomas Chandler and Ruth Evans; two letters, 1834, 1835, enclose copies of obituary notices on Elizabeth Chandler's death.

 Also part of the collection are sixty letters, 1830-1842, written to Elizabeth and Thomas Chandler, and Ruth Evans, from Ruth Evans' sister, Jane Howell, Philadelphia, Pa. Several of these letters refer to slavery and to anti-slavery leaders, such as William Lloyd Garrison, Benjamin Lundy, Evan Lewis, and Charles C. Burleigh, coeditor with his brother, William Henry, of the abolitionist newspaper <title render=""italic"">The Unionist</title>; a few refer to the financial and mercantile disruption caused by President Andrew Jackson's monetary policy, resulting in the panic of 1837; two letters, 1835, mention the boundary dispute between the State of Ohio and Michigan Territory (the Toledo War); others refer to a controversy between the Hicksite Friends and the Orthodox Friends in New York, the danger of a cholera epidemic, Indian difficulties, the increase of settlers in Michigan Territory, and other contemporary topics; one letter, 1832, encloses a certification of Thomas Chandler's membership in the Society of Friends, and one letter, 1834, encloses a poem on the death of George Dillwyn (1738-1821), Society of Friends preacher.

 Twenty-eight of the letters received by Elizabeth and Thomas Chandler and Ruth Evans in Michigan (1830-1852) were from other relatives and friends. Seven of these, 1831-38, were from Benjamin Lundy concerning a trip to Mexico, anti-slavery activities, and the first edition of Elizabeth Chandler's poems, which Lundy published in 1836; two letters, 1851, 1852, were from I. Prescott, publisher and bookseller of Salem, Ohio, discussing a republication of Elizabeth Chandler's poems; one, 1837, from Darius C. Jackson, delegate from Lenawee County to the Second Constitutional Convention of Assent, Ann Arbor, 1836, mentions the revision of Michigan laws, the Internal Improvement Bill, and the General Banking Laws Bill; one, 1837, from Isaac E. Crary, Michigan's first member of Congress acknowledges receipt of Thomas Chandler's petition against the Annexation of Texas, which Crary had presented to the House of Representatives; one, 1838, from William Bliss of Blissfield, lists the names of officers and members of the Anti-Slavery Society of Blissfield; one, 1839, from William L. Sullivan, Jackson, discusses Methodist anti-slavery meetings; one, 1838, describes the anti-abolitionist riots in Philadelphia, Pa., and the burning of Pennsylvania Hall, built in 1837 by anti-slavery societies for public meetings; three, 1837, are from Mathew Franklin Whittier (brother of John Greenleaf Whittier), Amesbury, Mass.

 A calendar arranged by name of correspondent is available in the reading room card files.","Elizabeth Margaret Chandler was born at Centre in the state of Delaware on December 24, 1807, to parents Margaret Evans and Thomas Chandler. Following the early death of her parents, Chandler moved with her family to Philadelphia where she attended the Society of Friends (Quaker) schools. At a young age, she also joined a female anti-slavery society and became committed to the cause of abolition. In 1826, Chandler began writing prose and poetry for the <title render=""italic"">Genius of Universal Emancipation</title>, a publication founded in 1812 by Benjamin Lundy.  Lundy invited Chandler to contribute after her 1825 poem ""The Slave-Ship,"" published in <title render=""italic"">The Casket</title>, received national attention.  Chandler eventually became an editor of <title render=""italic"">Genius of Universal Emancipation</title> and agreed to superintend its ""female department."" 

 In 1830, Chandler moved with aunt Ruth Evans and brother Thomas to the Michigan Territory, settling in Lenawee County near the village of Tecumseh.

The papers consist of seven series: Autobiographical and Biographical, Correspondence, Archaeology, Papers and Miscellaneous, Diaries, Record Books and Ledgers, and Photographs and Scrapbook.","Fred Dustin was born Frederick Greene O'Donnell on October 12, 1866, in Glens Falls, New York. After his mother died while he was still an infant, he was raised by his aunt and uncle, Sarah and Ira Dustin, and took their last name. He attended school through the eighth grade, then began working, taking jobs in sawmills and lumberyards.

 In 1887, Dustin moved to Saginaw, Michigan. After several years working in various jobs in the lumber industry, Dustin started his own carpentry business in 1890, building small items such as a hand washing machine called the Florin Washer. This business lasted until about 1900. From then on, Dustin tried his hand at a number of different types of employment, including stints as a census taker, mail carrier, weigh boss at a coal mine, building contractor, deputy state oil inspector, employment manager for a shipping plant, and Masonic Temple custodian. In his later years he ran a small bookshop out of his home and authored a book on General George Custer <title render=""italic"">The Custer Tragedy</title>, that was published in 1939. Health problems made regular employment difficult, but Dustin remained active most of his life.

 Dustin had a great interest in the archaeology of Michigan. He began collecting Native American artifacts around 1903 and continued for the rest of his life, amassing over 10,000 pieces. Most of his collection was eventually donated to the University of Michigan's Museum of Anthropology. In 1929, he was appointed by the university to make an archaeological survey of Isle Royale; the work lasted about seven weeks, followed up with a four-week return visit in 1930. In 1931, the Cranbrook Institute hired Dustin to survey the prehistoric earthworks in Ogemaw County, Michigan. He also served as W.B. Hinsdale's assistant in the compilation of the <title render=""italic"">Archaeological Atlas of Michigan</title>, published in 1931.

 Dustin was a charter member of the Michigan Archaeological Society and served a term as its vice president. He also published a number of articles on Saginaw archaeology and history in local newspapers in the hopes of generating interest in establishing a historical museum. In 1955, the Regents of the University of Michigan conferred a Citation of Honor upon Dustin for his contributions to the archaeology and history of the state.

 Dustin married Mary Stoker in 1888. Dustin died on May 15, 1957, in Saginaw, Michigan.",6667; 6130; 6832; 6831; 4198; 4199; 4131,Archaeology.; Indians of North America; Lumbering; Logging; Business enterprises; Dwellings; Living rooms.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3142; 3152,Photographs.; Diaries.,aat; aat,1700; 1571; 1220; 1739; 281; 282,Isle Royale (Mich.); Ogemaw County (Mich.); Saginaw (Mich.); Saginaw County (Mich.); Saginaw (Mich.); Saginaw (Mich.),lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm,5519; 5519; 3826; 5519; 7694; 698; 7404; 2456; 5123; 4521; 3559; 3663; 3690; 932,"Dustin, Fred, 1866-; Dustin, Fred, 1866-; Custer, George Armstrong, 1839-1876; Dustin, Fred, 1866-; Brucker, Wilber Marion, 1894-1968; Crawford, Fred L., 1888-1957; Ferris, Woodbridge N., 1853-1928; Mershon, Wm.

Starting from Lenawee County, Michigan with a three horse team on October 1, 1858, Doctor and Mrs. Hampton and their sons drove to St. Louis, boarded a freight boat and went down the Mississippi River to Gaines Landing, drove across Arkansas to Sulphur Springs, Texas, and eventually bought 160 acres of land six miles from Black Jack Grove, in hope of starting a stock farm.

Doctor Hampton practiced medicine and taught school for a year. Then he had to go North for supplies. Rumors began to spread that he had gone to obtain arms and ammunition and poison to distribute to the Negroes. People believed him to be a ""black abolitionist"" and they were determined he must leave the state or join the Rebel army. Troubles began for him and his family and any neighbors who befriended them. They suffered some harrowing and outrageous experiences at the hands of Texas Secessionists until Doctor Hampton, saying he was going to join the Rebel army, escaped into Arkansas where he joined the 9th Illinois Cavalry.

The notebooks are arranged, for the most part, chronologically for the period 1837 to 1893. Several notebooks that do not fit the chronological sequence are placed at the end of the series of notebooks. The notebooks for the years 1837 to 1840 have been bound, probably by Hubbard, into larger volumes. For convenience the later notebooks have been grouped into ""volumes"" by the library. Each ""volume"" is in a separate case. The notebooks contain personal journals, geological notes, and meteorological registers, along with sketches of landforms, scenery, and people, geological sections, and maps.

 A few loose papers are found at the end of the collection.

 The most extensive notebooks are those written between 1837 and 1840, when Hubbard was working for the Michigan Geological Survey, and in 1845 and 1846, when he was conducting the combined land and geological survey of the Upper Peninsula. In addition to the main sequence of notebooks for those years (volumes 1-8 and 10-12), that period is represented by separate meteorological registers (volumes 18 and 22), separate geological field notes for the 1840 expedition to the Lake Superior region (volume 21), and three reports on Hubbard's 1846 surveys (volumes 23-24 and loose papers).

 This finding aid contains two appendixes. The first, compiled by the initial cataloger of the collection in 1958, specifies where many of the topics indexed in the card catalog for this collection can be found in the series of notebooks. The second contains an inventory of the maps found in the collection.

For the rest of his long life, he occupied himself as a Detroit land speculator and lumber dealer.

 Hubbard was born in Hamilton, New York, in 1814, but moved as a child to Utica, New York. In 1834 he graduated from Hamilton College, and soon thereafter moved to Detroit to join his brother Henry in managing the family's farm and land agency. Hubbard was active in the Detroit Young Men's Society, serving as corresponding secretary and, in 1845, as president.

 In 1837, shortly after the Michigan Legislature established a geological survey to conduct a comprehensive study of the state's natural resources, the new state geologist, Douglass Houghton, appointed Hubbard his assistant. Hubbard served the Geological Survey from 1837 to 1841. Major field work undertaken by Hubbard for the survey included a coast survey of the Lake Huron and Michigan shores of the Lower Peninsula, done with Houghton in 1838; surveys of Wayne and Monroe Counties, also in 1838; and a survey of the Lake Superior coast and the copper region of Keweenaw Point with Houghton, in 1840. After 1840 the work of the Geological Survey was reduced, and Hubbard left the agency.

 Hubbard returned to Detroit in 1841 to study law. He began writing a column in the <title render=""italic"">Western Farmer</title>, becoming the editor in 1842. The journal ceased publication in 1843.

 In 1843 Houghton proposed that the U.S. land survey of the Upper Peninsula be combined with the state geological survey of the area. The following summer he contracted to perform the combined surveys. After Houghton's death in the fall of 1845, the surveys he had contracted to do were taken over by Hubbard and others. Hubbard surveyed the Huron Mountains area of Marquette and Baraga Counties with William Ives in 1845 and 1846. He also surveyed parts of Houghton and Ontonagon Counties in those years with Sylvester Higgins. Also in 1846 Hubbard edited and published with William Burt a report on the copper region based on Houghton's notes from his 1845 survey.

 After 1846 Hubbard left the field of geological survey, concerning himself more with the family land business. In 1854 he entered the lumber trade. Hubbard died in 1896, and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit.",8420; 7429; 8401; 6130; 7096; 8421; 7097,Fishes; Fishing; Geology; Indians of North America; Land use; Mines and mineral resources; Salt industry and trade,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3152,Diaries.,aat,1578; 1579; 1387; 1615; 1390; 2104; 2094; 1933; 1949; 2096; 1370; 1646; 1934; 1314; 950; 1312; 1483; 939; 1487; 1860; 1206; 2105; 937,"Barry County (Mich.); Berrien County (Mich.); Branch County (Mich.); Calhoun County (Mich.); Cass County (Mich.); Cliff Mine (Mich.); Clinton County (Mich.); Hillsdale County (Mich.); Huron, Lake (Mich. and Ont.); Ionia County (Mich.); Kent County (Mich.); Keweenaw Peninsula (Mich.); Lapeer County (Mich.); Lenawee County (Mich.); Mackinac Island (Mich.); Macomb County (Mich.); Michigan, Lake.; Upper Peninsula (Mich.); Monroe County (Mich.); Oakland County (Mich.); Plymouth (Mich.); Porcupine Mountains (Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie (Mich.)",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,157; 898; 8449; 8693; 157; 772,"Hubbard, Bela, 1814-1896; Douglas, Columbus C., 1812-1874; Higgins, Sylvester W.; Houghton, Douglass, 1809-1845; Hubbard, Bela, 1814-1896; Ives, William.",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,5070; 890,American Fur Company.; Detroit Young Men's Society.,lcnaf; lcnaf,,,

Administrative records and correspondence of governing bodies and committees document the regular operation of the MCC and MEF and materials related to activities such as Vietnam War protests, peace education, and ministry for migrant workers reveal the organization to be intimately involved in its community and a strong proponent for social justice. This collection will be of value to those interested in the history of Christian education and interfaith cooperation in Michigan as well as the role played by the church in the social activism of the 1960s and beyond. Upon their initial accession to the Bentley Historical Library, record series were constructed according to constitutional revisions; the present arrangement seeks a more organic coherence by uniting materials based upon function and the office of the creator. The Michigan Ecumenical Forum records are divided into three series: Administration, Organizational Activities and Units, and Visual Materials.","The History of the Michigan Ecumenical Forum (MEF) was one of evolution and growth. The organization's roots may be traced to 1860 when Sunday School advocates in Monroe, Kent, and Kalamazoo counties (and elsewhere across the state) coalesced to form the Michigan Sabbath School Association. Devoted to interchurch cooperation and as well as innovation and formalization in the Christian education of children and youths, the organization rapidly grew and by 1910 it reported having 518,000 Sunday school attendees statewide. It was formally incorporated as the Michigan Sunday School Association in 1916, appointed a general secretary I 1921, and in the following year changed its name the to the Michigan Sunday School Council of Religious Education (shortened in 1926 to the Michigan Council of Religious Education).

 The Michigan Council of Churches (MCC) itself was not organized until 1928 and held its first annual conference in 1930. The impetus for this new organization came from the Detroit Council of Churches, which in collaboration with the New York-based Home Missions Council, gathered various denominational officials from the state with the stated purpose: ""(1) to realize essential unity among the Christian forces of the State on a basis of mutual respect; (2) to develop an aggressive cooperative program for the churches in the interest of the Kingdom of God; (3) to encourage and assist in the formation and development of local councils"" (""The Bylaws of the Michigan Council of Churches, 1928). Original members of the MCC represented exclusively Protestant communions and included Baptist, Congregational, Disciples, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Reformed in U.S.A. congregations. In addition to Executive and Finance Committees, the MCC's main units focused on evangelism, comity and interchurch cooperation, religious education, and public welfare.

 On June 4, 1934, a 'Committee of Fourteen' comprised of seven appointees from both the MCC and the Michigan Council of Religious Education met to explore how the two organizations could work more efficiently in a broader range of fields. The meeting resulted in a recommendation that the two councils merge under the MCC banner, with tentative officers installed by January 1936 and the permanent organization established by January 1937 (a feat actually accomplished in October 1936).

 As it matured, the MCC's overall purpose became ""to exert spiritual and Christian leadership and to bring churches into living contact with one another for fellowship, study and cooperative action."" Over time, this open-ended statement of purpose enabled the MCC to serve as a clearinghouse for ecumenical action on social reform. Issues such as church location, world hunger, Christian education, protest against the Vietnam War, Indian and migrant missions, criminal justice, pastoral education, and race relations found their way onto the MCC agenda from 1957 through 1986. In theory, the organizational structure of the MCC provided a framework within which social reform and ecumenical concerns could be addressed. This structure established a neat hierarchy of an annual General Assembly overseeing a board of directors and executive committee, which, in turn, presided over the various departments and divisions.

 In practice, this hierarchical structure did not conform to the reality of changing social concerns. For example, the Council's opposition to the war in Vietnam saw a surge of activism that did not fit existing categories. When faced with such situations, the MCC modified its constitution and altered its organizational structure, usually at the division level, to accommodate the new reform impulse. Between 1957 and 1986 there were four such restructurings, a clear indication of the flexibility and changing sense of mission of the MCC. The 1957 constitution called for four divisions: Education, Life and Work, Missions, and Strategy and Church Planning. The 1964 version replaced the Life and Work Division with Church in Society, and it added the Christian Unity Division. The MCC devoted efforts to Christian education, missions, and development of churches, but it soon became apparent that two Church in Society subcommittees: Citizens Concerned About Vietnam and the Peace Education Program, commanded much of the MCC's attention and resources. This reality led to a twenty-eight month experiment, ""MCC-28"" during which a Program Development Table identified issues of concern and allocated resources to task forces formed to deal with specific problems. In this way the MCC was able to bring constitutionally-defined structures more in line with its actual activities. The flexible response allowed the Program Development Table to treat anti-Vietnam protest as program units of the MCC. The 1977 constitution reflected a similar issue-oriented organization functioning via task forces.

 Throughout the 1970s, MCC task forces dealt with an increasingly broad array of issues that included criminal justice, living and working conditions of migrant farm workers, world hunger, welfare reform, and peace. Faced with limited funds during Michigan's lean years in the early 1980s, the MCC realized that it could not be all things to all people. Mindful of a need to adapt in light of changes to itself and society, the MCC initiated a discussion of its future as early as 1978. By 1980, the organization realized that its vision for Christian unity needed an ecumenical vehicle more far-reaching and inclusive and so it opted to focus its efforts on developing a more extensive ecumenical presence in Michigan and at the same time downplay the role of its task forces. The result was an extensive Consultation on the Future of Ecumenism that stretched from 1980 to 1985 and was guided by a steering committee of MCC officials and denominational heads.

 The first phase of this Consultation (1980-1982) sought to articulate the changing ecumenical landscape in Michigan and how the MCC could respond while the second (1982-1984) developed plans to implement this vision. The final phase (1985) garnered support for a new ecumenical organization through the adoption of basic principles and Articles of Agreement by interested congregations and communions. 1985 and 1986 saw further work by the transition committee as well as three State Ecumenical Forums that paved the way for the commemoration of MCC's 'death'on October 23, 1986 and its rebirth as the Michigan Ecumenical Forum (MEF) on the following day.

 The MEF was officially constituted on January 1, 1987 and, as an inclusive interfaith group, welcomed Roman Catholic and Orthodox denominations. The organization preserved the MCC's tradition of holding General Assemblies; these State Ecumenical Forums provided delegates the opportunity to vote on programs and projects as well as members of the State Ecumenical Coordinating Committee (SECC, the successor to the MCC Board of Directors). Between General Assemblies, the SECC was the main decision-making body of the MEF; it was comprised of up to 39 individuals from a diversity of participating denominations and was headed by the MEF Chair. The MEF Executive Director also held a non-voting seat on the SECC and was the head of the Executive Committee, a body that provided general organizational oversight and was empowered to make decisions when the SECC was unable to meet.

 Although it represented a new start for the ecumenical movement in Michigan, the MEF carried on important objectives of its predecessor, including continued support for the development of Regional Ecumenical Forums. At the same time, the MEF consolidated its committees to address issues related to personnel, budget and finance, ecumenical mission, assembly planning, and Coordinating Committee nominations. The revised constitution also permitted the creation of ad hoc action committees and task teams to address specific issues or areas of concern as they emerged.

 The MEF last filed an annual report in 2001; after Executive Director Candyce Williams' untimely death on April 26, 2002, the organization appears to have fallen rapidly into decline. According to the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth, the MEF was slated for automatic dissolution on October 1, 2004.",9414; 9415; 9416; 9417; 8325; 9418; 9419; 9420; 9421; 9422,"Anti-racism; Christian education; Ecumenical movement; Interdenominational cooperation; Missions; Migrant workers; Native Americans; Vietnam War, 1961-1975; Peace education; Rural missions",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3142,Photographs.,aat,1475,Michigan,lcsh,,,,5620; 3812; 5620; 3812; 3753; 2795,Michigan Ecumenical Forum.; Michigan Council of Churches.; Michigan Ecumenical Forum.; Michigan Council of Churches.; Michigan Sunday School Association.; Michigan Council of Religious Education.,lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,,,

The originals of these materials are also available at the library; to best preserve the originals, access is limited to the microfilm copies.

 The correspondence includes letters from Monteith to members of his family and others discussing current events, his work, travel, places visited, temperance reform, slavery, and bank failures. There are also letters to/from Monteith's wife, Abigail, his daughter, Sarah, his sons George, John Jr., Charles, and Edwin, and scattered letters from other relatives and friends. George's letters cover his service as an officer in the Fourth Michigan Infantry during the Civil War. Besides the letters there are diaries kept by Monteith (1815-1838), notes on his library, sermons and a volume of sermon outlines, speeches, notes on class lectures and other subjects, personal account books, a notebook (1820) containing Chippewa-English vocabulary, student notes (1797-1798) taken by Alexander Monteith at Dickinson College. In addition, there is a manuscript play written by John Monteith Jr. entitled, ""The Raging Firelands,"" and a biography of Abigail Monteith, written by her son, Edwin (1859).

Of special interest is the annual report, Nov. 1818, of John Monteith to governor and judges of Michigan Territory concerning the University of Michigania. ","John Monteith was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on August 5, 1788. He graduated in 1813 from Jefferson College (name later changed to Washington and Jefferson). He continued his studies at Princeton Theological Seminary, graduating from there in 1816. Responding to a call to preach the gospel to the Protestant citizens of Detroit, Monteith moved to the Michigan Territory soon after graduation. In 1817, Monteith and the Reverend Father Gabriel Richard, Catholic Bishop of Michigan, along with other individuals began in Detroit the school which would become the University of Michigan. The name given for their institution was the Catholepistemiad or University of Michigania. Monteith served as first president with Father Gabriel Richard as vice president. During the five years that Monteith spent in Detroit, he also founded the First Protestant Society of Detroit (which became First Presbyterian Church); he also organized Michigan's oldest Presbyterian Church in Monroe; and he helped organize the Detroit library society. 

In 1820 Monteith married his first wife, Sarah S. Granger. After only five months of marriage, Sarah died while visiting her family in Ohio. Monteith married his second wife, Abigail Harris, of Florence, Ohio in August 1821. Abigail traveled with John to Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he had been appointed to the chair of ancient languages. He later taught in Cambridge, New York and Germantown, Pennsylvania. Abigail was deeply religious and worked with her husband caring for an Academy in Cambridge, NY.  In 1832 the Monteith’s moved to Elyria, Ohio, where Abigail cared for a young ladies boarding school in addition to raising the couple's nine children (only four survived). 

In 1845, Mr. and Mrs. Monteith moved to Blissfield, Michigan to continue their religious missionary work. John served as the pastor of the Presbyterian Church and Abigail hosted prayer meetings and educational lectures in their home.  The Monteith’s stayed in Blissfield for ten years, then returned to Elyria. John Monteith died on May 27, 1868 and Abigail died in 1880.",6557; 7698; 6130; 5839; 5912; 8425; 7805; 9525; 7482; 4953; 3707; 3732; 11090,"Banks and banking; Ojibwa Indians; Indians of North America; Antislavery movements; Temperance; Women; Mexican War, 1846-1848.; Spouses of clergy; Clergy; African American women; Military camps.; Military officers.; Women's resources.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; local,3261; 3152; 3193; 3491; 3142; 3466,Account books.; Diaries.; Sermons.; Daguerreotypes.; Photographs.; Tintypes.,aat; aat; aat; gmgpc; aat; gmgpc,1485; 934; 2402; 910; 910,Blissfield (Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Elyria (Ohio); United States; United States,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,4057; 4057; 4057; 8697; 5810; 3869; 6515; 7213; 6786; 431; 956,"Monteith, John, 1788-1868; Monteith, John, 1788-1868; Monteith, John, 1788-1868; Monteith, Abigail Harris, 1801-; Monteith, Alexander.; Monteith, Charles.; Monteith, Edward H.; Monteith, Edwin Harris.; Monteith, George, 1840-; Monteith, John, 1833-1918; Monteith, Sarah S.",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,5455; 4739; 3891; 2637; 2475; 2421,"Catholepistemiad (Detroit, Mich.); Dickinson College.; Hamilton College (Clinton, N.Y.); Presbyterian Church.; United States.

Correspondence, diaries and other materials concerning her professional interests, especially her work for world peace through international cooperation.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Stella Osborn collection was received in multiple accessions. The bulk of the papers were received from her home in Georgia (1958) and her office in Washington D.C. (1972). These materials documenting her entire career were organized into seven series: Biographical; Correspondence; Personal and miscellaneous; Atlantic Union Committee and related; Business and Professional Women's Club; Sound recordings; and Index card files. An extremely active woman with many interests and causes, Stella Osborn continued to add to her papers with a later accession in 1983. Following her death, the executor of her estate and other friends added to the collection with materials which she had retained for whatever reason or which had been in storage. There is obviously some overlap in these later materials and the files received previously. The purpose of the Summary Contents List (see below) is to draw like materials together.

 The 1992 accession was more fully described than the earlier papers. This accession includes biographical notes and clippings about Stella Osborn and Chase Osborn. There is, in addition, personal and organizational correspondence, financial and estate records (1970-1988), land deeds for the Osborn holdings in Georgia and Michigan, organizational material for the Federal Union and the Atlantic Union Committee, manuscripts of poetry, prose, and political essays (including some material by Chase Osborn), and Stella Osborn's diaries (1982-87). The collection includes childhood photographs of Stella Osborn and photographs of her parents and grandparents. Two copies of a videotape about the Osborn farm in Georgia, Possum Poke, are included here as well.

 Much of this accession documents the last few years of Stella Osborn's life, after her move to a retirement home in Sault St. Marie Michigan, years during which she maintained an interest in people and world peace organizations, and in documenting her own and Chase Osborn's place in history. While the bulk of correspondence here is for 1982, 1983, and 1987, some earlier correspondence is included as well. Of interest to university historians is the topical correspondence file on Robert Frost's visit to Michigan. Stella Osborn's lifelong friendship with Yuki Otsuki is documented by their extensive correspondence, a series of letters beautifully written and presented that recall earlier days, including student life.

 The collection contains some material of interest to researchers interested in Chase Osborn, including the series of land transfers and deeds which document Chase and Stella Osborn's extensive holdings in Georgia and Michigan, and their gifts of land to various charities and institutions. Also included is some Chase Osborn correspondence and copies of articles he wrote about his extensive travels in Africa. Chase Osborn's 1938 ""Longfellow Birthday Book"" contains the birth dates of his ancestors. Several letters from 1936 pertain to Chase Osborn's involvement in the movement to build the Mackinac Bridge.

 Of special interest to researchers interested in Stella Osborn and her role in various world peace organizations are her unpublished autobiographical manuscripts and files. Also of interest are her diaries, where she continued to record her ideas about politics and her memories.","Stella Brunt Osborn was born on July 31, 1894 in Hamilton, Canada. She finished elementary school in 1908, and subsequently went to work at the age of fifteen as a stenographer. She eventually completed her high school education through night classes in Toledo, Ohio. In 1916 she entered the University of Michigan, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1922. In 1930 she received a master's degree in Medieval English Literature, and in 1978, an honorary Doctorate of Letters, both from the University of Michigan.

 In the years 1923 to 1930 she worked as an editor for various publications. In 1931, she became the adopted daughter of Chase S. Osborn, ex-Governor of Michigan, and collaborated with him on five books: <title render=""italic"">The Conquest of a Continent</title>, 1939; <title render=""italic"">Schoolcraft-Longfellow-Hiawatha</title>, 1942; <title render=""italic"">Hiawatha with its Original Indian Legends</title>, 1944; <title render=""italic"">Errors in the U.S. Official Area Figures</title>, 1945; and <title render=""italic"">Northwood Sketches</title>, 1949. On her own Stella Osborn wrote <title render=""italic"">Eighty and on</title>, 1941; <title render=""italic"">A tale of Possum Poke in Possum Lane</title>, 1946; <title render=""italic"">Balsam Boughs</title>, 1949; <title render=""italic"">Jasmine Springs</title>, 1953; <title render=""italic"">Polly Cadotte</title>, 1955; <title render=""italic"">Beside the cabin</title>, 1957; <title render=""italic"">Iron and Arbutus</title>, 1962; and <title render=""italic"">Summer Songs on the St. Mary's</title>, 1982. On April 9, 1949 her adoption was annulled and she then married Chase Osborn.

 Since Chase Osborn's death (April 11, 1949), Stella Osborn's main interest has been in a number of international world peace organizations for which she has worked as a volunteer for nearly thirty years. These include the Atlantic Union Committee (founder and chairman, Michigan branch), the International Movement for Atlantic Union (founder of the North American branch; secretary 1958-1965), Federal Union, Inc. (board member, 1962), International Association for Federal Union (founder, honorary vice-president, 1972). She was also active in the Capitol Club of the Business and Professional Women's Club, and was a Distinguished Professor of Humanities at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tipton, Georgia. She retired in 1972, but maintained an active interest and correspondence with these organization.

 Stella Osborn died in Sault St. Marie in March 1988, where she had moved from Poulan, Georgia in 1980. In the last years of her life, she continued a lively interest in world affairs, actively corresponding with friends and with colleagues from the various peace organizations with which she had been involved.",5812; 6700; 5070; 6552; 3584; 5071; 3957; 3883; 5072; 3649; 4131; 4105; 3823; 5073; 5074; 4870; 3805; 7291; 3579; 5895,Peace; Social reformers; African Americans; Boy Scouts.; Clothing and dress.; Dogs.; Dwellings.; Families.; Historical markers; Interiors.; Living rooms.; Log cabins.; Monuments and memorials.; Motion picture devices; Native Americans; Prison facilities; Streets; Television broadcasting; Women.; Women college students,lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh,3480; 3152; 3476; 3142; 3141,Ambrotypes.; Diaries.; Paintings.; Photographs.; Videotapes.,gmgpc; aat; gmgpc; aat; aat,2461; 209; 2459; 2462; 633; 596; 2463,"Sugar Island (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Duck Island (Chippewa County, Mich.); Ewen (Mich.); Indiana; Jackson (Mich.); Poulon (Ga.)",lcsh; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh,3067; 2497; 3067; 2497; 3067; 4480; 7013; 2003; 4345; 93; 2252; 132; 7939; 1378; 7806; 9010; 3634; 1778; 6978; 560; 6023; 1389; 7411; 5295; 462; 2983; 2011; 978; 7694; 5284; 5584; 1147; 5159; 1163; 3155; 7358; 630; 5590; 8931; 2956; 4688; 3448; 3591; 3648; 8954; 5843; 1327; 7469; 3546; 698; 2488; 1630; 5834; 7736; 5770; 5213; 6150; 3027; 3848; 2894; 5947; 2919; 1549; 1118; 7533; 4529; 3805; 983; 5866; 3116; 6163; 8037; 6388; 8499; 7836; 7421; 1894; 3540; 6338; 1296; 4188; 4962; 1352; 8117; 4445; 964; 5818; 5811; 4477; 123; 8079; 8090; 3864; 4600; 5752; 6259; 3877; 6285; 2946; 415; 94; 4297; 8321; 2190; 338; 4217; 2685; 8978; 7855; 2231; 4187; 6307; 3423; 2986; 437; 1192; 4451; 1575; 3243; 4712; 1323; 1335; 5533; 7884; 7515; 5434; 3472; 768; 7853; 7044; 5527; 6341; 397; 866; 8813; 1737; 4390; 2693; 1963; 3856; 4044; 794; 6235; 4131; 1228; 5874; 12; 6626; 6120; 3872; 6875; 5723; 1475; 6533; 4312; 3490; 1468; 8473; 6624; 8194; 1873; 6401; 5401; 1345; 3019; 5920; 2617; 7454; 3890; 9082; 4655; 7905; 4658; 2777; 2128; 697; 514; 370; 3080; 1912; 4327; 7107; 5359; 5358; 2724; 6054; 2888; 919; 2605; 2610; 6532; 5577; 1971; 4474; 5580; 5357; 4018; 513; 8249; 3317; 3817; 5970; 6827; 2824; 8058; 3385; 3232; 6319; 5642; 1496; 7104; 5918; 329; 7954; 1267; 5010; 5250; 3900; 1671; 1803; 5603; 3615; 266; 2075; 9046; 893; 2965; 8682; 1083; 8191; 1769; 3690; 1358; 8825; 3995; 4375; 4008; 126; 4200; 6715; 8139; 5903; 759; 2033; 3938; 3904; 4310; 6796; 1736; 7171; 34,"Osborn, Stellanova, 1894-1988; Osborn, Chase S.

Born in Jackson, Michigan on June 3, 1945 to Warren Frank and Juanita Mae Petoskey, he was 9 years old when his great-aunt Ella Petoskey gave him the name Biidassige (""Light that is Coming"") in honor of his great-great-grandfather, Ignatius Petoskey (for whom the city of Petoskey, Michigan was named).

Petoskey was ordained as a Christian minister in 1971 after attending a service at The Apostolic Church in Auburn Hills, Michigan. While working as a certified addictions counselor, spiritual traditionalist counselor, and house manager for a Native American treatment program, Petoskey came to understand that his clients often experienced residual effects from the American Indian residential schools that many (including his father and grandfather, Cornelius Joseph Petoskey) were forced to attend. This realization led Warren to found Dawnland Native Ministries in 1998; based near Petoskey, Michigan, this outreach program endeavors ""to build bridges of understanding with all peoples regarding the damage done by America's boarding school policies and their effects on the current generations.""  To that end, he has traveled around Michigan and across the United States with his wife, Barbara Louise Curton Petoskey, giving presentations regarding historical trauma and boarding school syndrome. 

Petoskey is also a poet and essayist; his 2009 memoir, <title render=""italic"">Dancing My Dream</title>, details his childhood, the stories of his family and ancestors, and his spiritualism and way of life.

Collection includes business records, articles about the bookselling industry, press coverage, photographs, printed broadsides, catalogs, store newsletters and posters documenting events at the Shaman Drum. Also contains records of Pohrt's other business affiliations and involvement in local cultural initiatives such as the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair and the Ann Arbor Book Festival.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Karl Pohrt papers consist of materials relating to Pohrt's personal life, education, teaching, business ventures, and involvement in professional associations and community initiatives. Photographs, personal writings, signed broadsides, and correspondence document Pohrt's contact and friendships with writers and academics. In addition, the Pohrt papers include press articles and documentation from meetings providing a view into the effects of online retail on the bookselling industry.","Karl Weidner Pohrt is perhaps best known as the owner of the Shaman Drum, an independent bookstore in Ann Arbor, yet he was also a poet, activist, teacher, scholar and publisher. An accomplished scholar of American 'Beat Generation' literature and practicing Buddhist, Pohrt was also a longtime friend of the poet Gary Snyder. Pohrt was born in 1948 in Flint, Michigan. His farther Richard Pohrt was a noted collector of Native American art and artifacts. After earning his bachelor's degree in English at the University of Michigan-Flint in 1970, Pohrt worked at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor to fulfill his service obligation as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War. He then worked as a bookseller at Centicore Books, a bookstore in Ann Arbor in the early seventies, before finishing a master's degree in American Culture at the University of Michigan in 1978. While working on his master's degree, Pohrt helped establish the Bear Claw Press in Ann Arbor with his brother, artist and illustrator Tom Pohrt. Karl Pohrt also worked as a writing instructor in the 1970s and taught English and composition as an adjunct at the University of Michigan Flint in 1980. He left teaching to open an independent bookstore on State Street in Ann Arbor in 1981.

 The Shaman Drum Bookshop went on to become a nationally recognized bookstore as well as a central gathering place for the community of arts and letters in Ann Arbor. Despite the rise of online booksellers, textbook sales helped keep Pohrt's business financially sustainable. Pohrt cultivated a niche for readers interested in scholarly and academic literature, while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere attractive to the Ann Arbor community at large. Located at 311 S State Street in downtown Ann Arbor, Shaman Drum's proximity to the University's Central Campus also helped strengthen town-gown relations.

 Pohrt served several terms as the president of the American Bookseller's Association. In addition, Pohrt was a board member for the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority and State Street Association. He also served as the president of the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair in 2006 and helped with the founding of the first Ann Arbor Book Festival in 2003. Pohrt helped co-found an initiative known as ""Reading the World"" in 2005, inviting independent booksellers and publishers nationwide to display foreign literature published in translation each year through the month of May. In 2006, George Eley, a University of Michigan professor of German history, received a distinguished professorship and named it for Karl Pohrt, becoming the Karl Pohrt Distinguished University Professor of Contemporary History. Eley explained he wanted to honor Pohrt's commitment to promoting the humanities and higher education in Ann Arbor to help improve the political, social, and cultural life of the city.

 Despite the success and the reputation of the Shaman Drum as a center for cultural and intellectual gatherings in Ann Arbor, increased competition with online booksellers and other forms of digital publication during the economic recession resulted in a steep and sudden decline in sales at the Shaman Drum, pushing Pohrt to dramatically adjust the store's mission and strategic plan. In February 2008, Pohrt announced that he would transform his privately owned store into a nonprofit literary arts center. With this transition, Pohrt intended to expand the shop's community programming from poetry readings, book signings, and literary receptions to offer courses in literature and creative writing. He opened the Great Lakes Literary Arts Center at the Shaman Drum Bookshop in the summer of 2008. Nevertheless, the combined forces of the recession and continuing competition with online retailers and Internet media ultimately took their toll on the Shaman Drum. Pohrt closed the Shaman Drum in June 2009.

 After closing down his business, Pohrt continued to write about books, culture and ideas in his personal blog. Pohrt was diagnosed with cancer in October 2012 and continued to publish his blog until May 2013. He died on July 10, 2013 and was survived by his wife, Diane, and two daughters.",9618; 9871; 5715; 9872; 8052; 9873; 5008; 5132,Book industries and trade; Bookstores; Festivals; Independent bookstores; Indians of North America; Publishers and publishing; Bookstores.; Writers.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm,3165; 3191; 3365; 3216; 3145,Audiocassettes.; Digital file formats.; Floor plans.; Portraits.; Posters.,aat; aat; aat; aat; aat,,,,6257; 6257; 3145; 6801,"Pohrt, Karl, 1948-2013; Pohrt, Karl, 1948-2013; Pohrt, Richard A., 1911-2005; Snyder, Gary, 1930-",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,1324; 1504,Bear Claw Press.; Shaman Drum Bookshop.,lcnaf; lcnaf,,,

The collection's three series contain Sheppard's articles and writings, press releases and newspaper articles written by others, government reports and publications, audio and visual materials.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Glen Sheppard Papers comprises materials collected and maintained by Glen Sheppard over the course of his career as editor and writer for the <title render=""italic"">North Woods Call</title>. The collection is divided into three series entitled Topical Files (First Alphabet), Topical Files (Second Alphabet), and Visual Materials. The Topical Files (First Alphabet) series contains materials on a greater array of topics than the Second Alphabet, though the latter is the larger of the two series. The two Topical files have been kept separate in accordance with Sheppard's own filing system. Materials within topical headings have likewise been maintained largely as Sheppard had organized them. Photographs are found interspersed with other materials in various topical files throughout the collection. The Visual Materials series comprises photographs, negatives, and maps that have been filed separately from the rest of the collection. A large proportion of the photographs in this series are alphabetized according to topic. Such topics include wildlife (namely birds, fish, and game animals), hunting and fishing, people (mainly politicians and important figures involved in Michigan conservation), and landscape photographs.

 The Topical Files are primarily composed of various drafts of articles, press releases and newspaper articles written by other environmental journalists, research materials and notes, correspondence (mainly faxes), and photographs. The collection also contains a great deal of material pertaining to various government agencies, including bills and acts of legislation, memoranda, interoffice communications, reports and research studies, and pamphlets and other literature published and distributed by said agencies. These agencies include government bodies devoted to conservation issues, chief among which is the DNR (Department of Natural Resources). Other government agencies represented in this collection include the NRC (Natural Resources Commission) and the DEQ (Department of Environmental Quality). The collection also contains selected clippings from the <title render=""italic"">North Woods Call</title> along with logistical papers pertaining to the <title render=""italic"">Call's</title> operation.

 The collection features materials on a broad array of topics of environmental import for the state of Michigan. The First Alphabet and Second Alphabet series feature articles, reports, environmental impact statements, and resource management plans pertaining to environmental issues impacting particular Michigan towns and counties. Such issues include the impact of corporations, factories, oil and gas resource exploitation, and pollution. The collection also includes files on the topics of land use management, water resource management, fisheries management, and Native American rights to Michigan's natural resources. The collection contains Sheppard's researches on Michigan flora and fauna (concentrated in the Second Alphabet series), with particular emphasis on deer, wolves, bears, and various species of fish. Sheppard's researches also include coverage of endangered wildlife, invasive species, and zoological diseases. The collection contains articles and research materials concerning hunting, fishing, tourism, and outdoorsmanship. Michigan's islands, rivers, lakes (particularly the Great Lakes), national and state parks, nature preserves and conservancies, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges are all well represented in the collection (mainly in the Second Alphabet series). The collection also includes papers pertaining to the administrations of Michigan governors John Engler and Jennifer Granholm.","Glen Sheppard was raised in Romulus, Michigan, and exhibited an early interest in the newspaper business, which was encouraged by his father. Sheppard enlisted in the army in 1950 and served for three years during the Korean War. Upon his release and return to Michigan, Sheppard worked for various newspapers in the greater Detroit area. A few years later he returned to the army for another three-year tour, during which time he was stationed at Fort Greely, Alaska. Upon his second release Sheppard again worked for a number of newspapers, including the <title render=""italic"">New York Herald Tribune</title> and the <title render=""italic"">Charlevoix Courier</title>.

 In 1969 Sheppard took over the <title render=""italic"">North Woods Call</title>, a small conservationist newspaper founded in 1953 by Marguerite Gahagan. Sheppard would be the owner, publisher, editor, and principal writer of the <title render=""italic"">Call</title> for the next 40 years. The <title render=""italic"">Call</title> published conservation news, editorials, and expository pieces on the topics of conservation legislation, scientific research, and outdoorsmanship. Sheppard built a network of well-placed sources ranging from politicians to scientists and members of environmentalist organizations. Under Sheppard's leadership the <title render=""italic"">Call</title> became a publication to which various politicians, government agencies, and environmental journalists for larger newspapers subscribed.

 Sheppard's journalism challenged the actions of government agencies, corporations, and individuals threatening the integrity of Michigan conservation. During Governor John Engler's administration, Sheppard's criticism of government bureaucracy resulted in the <title render=""italic"">Call</title> being banned from field offices of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Sheppard built a journalistic reputation as a staunch and unapologetic defender of the natural resources and wildlife of Northern Michigan. Sheppard died on January 5th, 2011 at the age of 74. The <title render=""italic"">North Woods Call</title> has since been purchased and re-launched.

Louis Sifferath, a panorama of the village waterfront, and a plat map of Cross Village Township.",The finding aid is written in English,"The Mary Shurtleff collection consists of documents and images relating to Cross Village and its inhabitants. The collection is arranged in 3 series: Business records, Other collected documents, and Visual materials.","Cross Village is located in northwest Emmet County, Michigan. Over the course of its history it has been variously known as Waganakisi, Anamiewatigoing, L'Arbre Croche, Old Arbre Croche, LaCroix, and Cross Village, after its namesakes, a crooked tree and a large cross in the village.

 The Ottawa inhabited the village beginning in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. A Jesuit mission was also established in the village, though abandoned in the late eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century Catholic priests once again served in the village including Father Francis Pierz (1830s), Father Ignatius Mrak (1840s to mid-1850s), Father Seraphim Zorn (late 1850s), Father Loius Sifferath (1860s), and Father John Bernard Weikamp (1855-1889).

 Treaties between the United States Government and the Ottawa and Chippewa (several of whom had moved to Cross Village sometime after 1830) resulted in them being granted tracts of land in the area during the mid-to-late nineteenth century. One early initiative was to move the village from the shore to the bluff. In the late 1840s, several Ottawa pooled their resources and gave their chief, Joseph Nawimashkote ""full power to purchase land for use at the cross, that we may own it in common"" (Shurtleff, 1963, p. 11). Upon his death, the land was to be redistributed to those who had contributed to its acquisition.

 Members of the Shurtleff family first moved to Cross Village in 1870. Captain John Wagley, who himself had come to Cross Village in 1865, had established the first district school in Emmet County and engaged John S. Shurtleff to teach there. Two of Shurtleff's sons, Orville Homer and William Melville, went into business together in Cross Village and built a store in 1883. Mary Belle Shurtleff was William's daughter. She wrote a history of Cross Village <title render=""italic"">Old Arbre Croche</title>, published in 1933, 1945, 1955, and 1963, and also collected various historical documents related to the village.

Also material, 1979-2000, relating to John Sinclair's work as a writer, performer, radio show host and music promoter.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The John Sinclair papers came to the library in 1979. Jointly donated by John and Leni Sinclair, this initial accession, covering the period 1957-1979, included textual material, sound recordings, and photographs relating to all phases of their careers, including participation in the Artists' Workshop in Detroit, the Rainbow Multi-Media Corporation, the White Panther Party and its offshoot, the Rainbow Peoples Party; also materials concerning the legalization of marijuana, radical politics, prison reform, and rock and jazz music.

 The Sinclair papers provide a rich and unique source for the study of America's radical movement in the nineteen sixties and seventies. Beginning with a remarkable series of correspondence that includes letters from Abbie Hoffman, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, and Jerry Rubin, and continuing on through extensive subject files, the collection details the cultural, political and business activities of a man whose energy and charisma made him a local and national leader of the counterculture. In addition, the collection documents the support and creativity of his wife and partner, who as writer, photographer and publicist helped to showcase the lifestyle which he symbolized.

 Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, John Sinclair added to his papers with materials relating to his career as a writer and performer. In the winter of 2000, he donated a second large accession relating mainly to the period since leaving Detroit for New Orleans.

 The Sinclair collection has been divided into four subgroups: Textual Files, Printed Material, Sound Recordings, and Visual Material.","John and Leni Sinclair were leaders of the counterculture movement in Michigan, organizers of radical social, political, and cultural endeavors primarily in the areas of music, poetry, graphic design, and community welfare projects. During the 1960s and 1970s John Sinclair founded or was active a variety of political and cultural groups including the Artists' Workshop in Detroit, the Rainbow Multi-Media Corporation, the White Panther Party and its offshoot, the Rainbow Peoples Party; and had ties to various national radical organizations. He was an organizer of the Ann Arbor Jazz and Blues Festival and concerts and managed several rock bands, most notably the MC5. He was arrested for passing marijuana cigarettes to an undercover agent and was the subject of several significant legal proceedings involving government surveillance and wiretapping. After 1979 Sinclair devoted most of his time to writing, music journalism, hosting a radio program and to live performances of his poetry, generally with the accompaniment of a jazz or blues band. In 1990 Sinclair left Detroit for New Orleans.

 John Sinclair was born October 2, 1941 in Flint, Michigan and grew up in nearby Davison where he graduated from high school in 1959. He attended Albion College (1959-61) and the University of Michigan, Flint College (1962-64), where he received an A.B. degree in American literature. In April 1964 he entered graduate school at Wayne State University. He completed course work for an M.A. in American literature (thesis on William Burroughs' <title render=""italic"">Naked Lunch</title>) before dropping out in the fall of 1965 to pursue his activities in the Detroit jazz and poetry community.

 On November 1, 1964, shortly after his first arrest for ""sales and possession of marijuana,"" Sinclair founded (with his partner Leni Arndt, poet/film maker Robin Eichele, trumpeter Charles Moore and twelve others) the Detroit Artists' Workshop, which was a local attempt in self-determination for artists of all disciplines. During 1964-1967, under the auspices of the Artists' Workshop and its campus counterpart, the Wayne State University Artists' Society (which he also originated), Sinclair produced countless jazz concerts and poetry readings featuring Detroit talent. He helped organize the Detroit Contemporary 4, the Workshop Arts Quartet and the Workshop Music Ensemble, an experimental group for which he also composed original music. Together with Robin Eichele, George Tysh and Jim Semark he founded (1964) and co-directed the Artists' Workshop Press which published a series of books, magazines, and free sheets by Detroit poets and writers, including his own <title render=""italic"">This is Our Music</title> (1965), <title render=""italic"">Fire Music: A Record</title> (1966), <title render=""italic"">The Poem for Warner Stringfellow</title> (1966), and <title render=""italic"">Meditations: a suite for John Coltrane</title> (1967).

 Sinclair served as editor of the Artists' Worksheet newsletter (1965), the poetry magazine <title render=""italic"">Work</title>, (1965-67), the ""avant-jazz"" magazine <title render=""italic"">Change</title> (1965-66), and (with Ron Caplan) the magazine <title render=""italic"">Whe're</title> (1966), all printed at the Artists' Workshop Press. Sinclair was also music editor and columnist (1965-68) for Detroit's <title render=""italic"">Fifth Estate</title> newspaper, one of the original five members of the Underground Press Syndicate (UPS), and founded and edited (with Allen Van Newkirk) the first issues of <title render=""italic"">Guerilla</title> (1966-67), a newspaper of cultural revolution. His other editorial responsibilities in the areas of music and/or poetry-literature included those with <title render=""italic"">Spero</title> (Chicago, 1963-65), <title render=""italic"">Art &amp; Artists</title> (Detroit, 1964-65) and <title render=""italic"">New University Thought</title> (1965). A very prolific writer as well, Sinclair served as local correspondent for <title render=""italic"">Downbeat</title> (1964-65) and <title render=""italic"">Jazz</title> (New York) magazines, and had his articles, reviews and poetry appear in numerous other publications besides those he edited, including: <title render=""italic"">American Poet</title>, <title render=""italic"">Camels Coming</title>, <title render=""italic"">Coda</title>, <title render=""italic"">Connections</title>, <title render=""italic"">El Corno Emplumade</title>, <title render=""italic"">Incense</title>, <title render=""italic"">Island, Jazz</title> (Warsaw), <title render=""italic"">The Journal</title>, <title render=""italic"">Kaleidoscope</title>, <title render=""italic"">Kulchur</title>, <title render=""italic"">Latitudes</title>, <title render=""italic"">Magazine</title>, <title render=""italic"">Move</title>, <title render=""italic"">New Lantern</title>, <title render=""italic"">Club Review</title>, <title render=""italic"">Orpheus</title>, <title render=""italic"">Other Scenes</title>, <title render=""italic"">Out of Sight</title>, the <title render=""italic"">Paper</title> (Lansing), <title render=""italic"">Poetmeat</title>, <title render=""italic"">San Francisco Oracle</title>, <title render=""italic"">Seed</title>, <title render=""italic"">Sounds</title> (Germany), and <title render=""italic"">Sounds &amp; Fury</title>. In July 1965 he read his works at the Berkeley Poetry Conference along with Ed Sanders, Ted Berrigan, and Lenore Kandel. He taught courses in jazz and contemporary poetry in the self-education program at the Artists' Workshop's Free University of Detroit and his poems were anthologized in <title render=""italic"">For Malcolm X</title> (Broadside Press) and <title render=""italic"">Poems Now</title> (Kulchur Press) in 1966.

 Sinclair was sentenced on February 24, 1966 to six months in the Detroit House of Correction for a second arrest (Oct. 1965) on ""sales and possession of marijuana."" Following his release he became associated with the Grande Ballroom in Detroit (Oct. 1966) but was arrested a third time on January 24, 1967, with 55 other people in a ""hippy dope raid on campus!""

 In February 1967 Sinclair organized (with his partner and now wife Leni Arndt Sinclair and artist Gary Grimshaw) a ""total cooperative tribal living and working commune,"" Trans-Love Energies Unlimited, as an attempt to consolidate the energies of organized units of the developing counterculture. Trans-Love produced rock and roll dance concerts, light shows, books, pamphlets, posters, and the Warren-Forest <title render=""italic"">Sun</title> newspaper (founded and edited by Sinclair and Gary Grimshaw), and served as a cooperative booking agency for rock groups the MC 5, the Stooges, and Billy C. and the Sunshine. In August 1967 Sinclair became the personal manager of the MC 5, and his brother David Sinclair began managing Frank Bach's band the UP, as Trans-Love turned most of its attention to a rock and roll ""assault"" that would turn young people on to the possibilities of cultural revolution. In May-June 1968, after two fire-bombings of the commune, Sinclair re-established the entire organization in two huge homes at 1520 Hill Street near the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor. Despite this move, John Sinclair remained active in the Detroit scene as the main publicity-production-promotional advisor to Russ Gibb's Grande Ballroom operation and as the producer (along with Darlene Pond) of Gibb's Detroit Rock &amp; Roll Revival in May 1969.

 Deeply influenced by the Black Panther leaders Huey Newton and Eldridge Cleaver, Sinclair (with Pun Plamondon) founded the White Panther Party in November 1968, serving first as its minister of information and later as chairman. The ten-point program of the White Panther Party demanded economic and cultural freedom. ""Everything free for everybody!"" and a total ""assault"" on the culture by any means necessary were the essence of the White Panther program.

 The MC 5 and later the UP and UPRISING continued to spearhead the mass work of the now politically conscious revolution, while the other cultural work of Trans-Love Energies was also carried on. Sinclair began to write for <title render=""italic"">CREEM</title>, the original Warren-Forest <title render=""italic"">Sun</title> became the White Panther Information Service's <title render=""italic"">Sun dance</title>, and the Ann Arbor <title render=""italic"">Argus</title>, which had begun independently under the editorship of Ken Kelley, was mobilized as a semi-official White Panther Party organ. Originally conceived as an arm of the Youth International Party founded by Abbie Hoffman earlier in 1968, and organized around local issues in Ann Arbor such as free concerts in the parks, the White Panther Party soon had affiliated chapters established nationwide.

 In July 1969 Sinclair was sentenced to prison for 9 ½ to 10 years for possession of two marijuana cigarettes. While in prison he assembled and wrote <title render=""italic"">Guitar Army</title> (a Douglas/World book) and published another collection of writings, <title render=""italic"">Music &amp; Politics</title> (World, 1971), co-authored by Robert Levin. His prolific writings appeared in numerous publications and made him a national symbol more influential than ever before. Two-and-a-half years of legal and political battles culminated at Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor on December 10, 1971, when 15,000 people attended the Free John Now Rally headlined by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Just three days later, the Michigan Supreme Court, on its own motion, ordered Sinclair released and later overturned his conviction, upholding his contention that Michigan's marijuana statutes were unconstitutional and void.

 Prior to Sinclair's release from prison, the cultural operations of Trans-Love Energies had been inherited by the newly evolved Rainbow Energies, Inc., a Michigan non-profit organization, and its distribution division, the Rainbow Trucking Company. After months of self-examination, on April 30, 1971, the White Panther Party dissolved to form the Rainbow People's Party. Chaired by Sinclair, the Rainbow People's Party embraced Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action and concentrated on building a strong local political organization to promote the revolutionary struggle for a ""communal, classless, anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anti-sexist...culture of liberation..."" Sinclair's energies for promoting cultural change, however, were soon to be more heavily channeled through another organization.

 Early in 1972, Sinclair founded (with Peter Andrews) the Rainbow Multi-Media Corporation, serving as its vice- president and creative director. A Michigan non-profit organization, Rainbow Multi-Media (RMM) was designed as an alternative music-business company with a community-service orientation. To further its ultimate goal of restructuring the music industry and the entire society as well along cooperative, creative and communalistic lines, the company made its resources available on a cost-or-less basis to community organizations committed to progressive social change. Besides his direct responsibilities in the Rainbow Productions and Rainbow Management divisions (the heart of the RMM business) and for overall coordination of the company's complex business operations, Sinclair had further direct responsibilities in the Graphics, Advertising, Video, Radio Productions, and Press divisions. He was personal manager of the band ""Detroit,"" helped organize and establish the Rockets, and co-produced the Ann Arbor Blues &amp; Jazz Festivals (1972-1974). He handled all booking for the Community Park Program and the Ann Arbor People's Ballroom (projects of the Ann Arbor Tribal Council), managed the Rainbow Room at the old Shelby Hotel in Detroit, and produced a weekly radio program, ""Toke Time,"" on Ann Arbor's WNRZ-FM. During this period he also continued to be active in the areas of prison and drug reform, helping to organize the Michigan Committee for Prisoner's Rights, touring California in 1971 and 1972 (with his wife, Leni) to promote the Marijuana Initiative there, returning to organize the Michigan Marijuana Initiative, and serving on the Board of Directors for the San Francisco-based Amorphia, Inc., a national non-profit corporation for drug education, research and reform.

 Following the massive financial failure of the 1974 Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival In Exile and the subsequent collapse of the entire Rainbow Multi-Media operation (Oct. 1974), the Sinclairs, along with other principals of the RMM, formed Rainbow Productions, Inc. Subsequently moving to Detroit in 1975, the firm, which Sinclair headed as president and creative director, continued with most of the activities of the defunct Rainbow Corporation including advertising and public relations, printing, photography, graphics, recording, concert production and artist and club management. Sinclair served as Arts Editor and later as Editor-in-chief of the Detroit <title render=""italic"">Sun</title> (moved from Ann Arbor) until publication was suspended in October 1976.

 In May 1977 Sinclair was named State Coordinator of Michigan NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws), taking a leave of absence from Rainbow Productions to work full time in that capacity. In August 1977, Sinclair, with partners Frank Bach, Peggy Taube, and other principals of Rainbow Productions, Inc. and the Strata Corporation, formed Strata Associates, Inc., where as its president and creative director he specialized in servicing the entertainment industry, minority business enterprise, publishing consultation, and special marketing. Among the non-profit music cooperatives served were the Allied Artists Association, Jazz Development Workshop and Jazz Research Institute.

 After leaving Strata in 1979 Sinclair served as Executive Director of the Detroit Jazz Center, a non-profit organization which held performances and classes, produced a radio show and attempted to record and document Detroit's jazz music heritage. After financial struggles led to the dissolution of the Jazz Center in 1981, Sinclair, along with partner Dominic Morda, established Morda, Sinclair and Associates (MSA), a music management, booking and production company. MSA served as the management company for local musical acts, most notably the Urbations, and performed talent coordination for local area clubs. Sinclair served as Vice President and Creative Director of MSA.

 During the late 1970s and early 1980s Sinclair also served as a board member and project director for the Allied Artists Association, Inc. of Detroit, and hosted several radio programs on community based radio stations including WCBN-FM, Ann Arbor, and WDET, Detroit. He was honored for his design work and promotion of jazz in Detroit. Long active in community arts and political circles in Michigan, his other associations included: Friends of Belle Isle Board of Directors, Founders Society of the Detroit Institute of the Arts, the African Art Gallery Committee of the DIA, the NAACP, the Michigan Advertising Council, the Detroit Press Club and the Motor City Cultural Association Board of Directors.

 In 1982, after several years of inactivity, Sinclair returned to poetry writing. Influenced by Ed Sanders' concept of ""Investigative Poetry,"" in which the author attempts to investigate and document the human experience in an almost journalistic manner, Sinclair began work on two volumes of poetry. <title render=""italic"">Thelonious: A Book of Monk</title>, is a book of intensely personal poems inspired by, and sharing the same titles as, the works of Thelonious Monk. In <title render=""italic"">Fattening Frogs For Snakes: A Delta Sound Suite</title>, Sinclair documents the lives of legendary Mississippi blues musicians, often transcribing the blues men's quotes into verse. Sinclair also began to perform his poetry in solo performances and with a backing band, the Motor City Blues Scholars. A book of Sinclair's collected poetry, <title render=""italic"">We Just Change the Beat</title>, was published in 1988.

 In 1988 Sinclair began work as the editor for <title render=""italic"">City Arts Quarterly</title>, a magazine published by the Detroit Council of the Arts. His journalism pieces appeared in <title render=""italic"">City Arts Quarterly</title> as well as the <title render=""italic"">Detroit Metro Times</title> and other newspapers and magazines. Sinclair also began to teach classes on the history and development of popular music at Wayne State University and continued to host and produce radio programs on community-based stations. In 1990, he was fired as Editor of <title render=""italic"">City Arts Quarterly</title> and filed a lawsuit against the city of Detroit, alleging that he was terminated as a result of an attempt to print a story advocating a plan for the renovation of Tiger Stadium, which Detroit Mayor Coleman Young opposed. Several months after losing his job Sinclair announced that the firing had reminded him of his clashes with the Detroit and Michigan political establishments two decades earlier, and that he planned to move to New Orleans.

 Once settled in New Orleans, Sinclair continued his artistic pursuits. He continued work on <title render=""italic"">Thelonius: A Book of Monk</title> and <title render=""italic"">Fattening Frogs for Snakes</title>, as well as other poetry projects, and began performing with a New Orleans version of the Blues Scholars. Sinclair also continued writing liner notes for record releases, and columns and other music related pieces for local and national publications. He became involved with WWOZ, one of the country's leading non-commercial radio stations, producing blues and jazz focused radio shows and serving on the station's board of directors. Sinclair also became involved in community groups such as the White Buffalo Day Foundation, a group which attempts to raise awareness of Native American issues in New Orleans, and The Professor Long Hair Foundation, an organization dedicated to preserving the legacy of influential jazz musicians.

 Sinclair also established his own independent record label, Total Energy Records, along with a production company called Big Chief Productions. Total Energy Records, in conjunction with other labels, released recordings of Sinclair's own poetry as well as live recordings of the MC 5 and formerly out of print material from the UP. In addition to promoting Sinclair's own work, Big Chief has supplied master recordings of many Detroit area acts and live musical events, including performances from the 1970s Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festivals, to record companies in various parts of the United States, Europe and Japan

 Throughout the 1990s Sinclair has continued writing and performing. He has released four recordings of poetry, and in 1996 and 1997 undertook tours of the Midwest, and East and West Coasts of the United States, as well as several European countries. He continues to produce weekly radio broadcasts for WWOZ radio. Sinclair has also continued his journalistic pursuits, and was recently named managing editor of <title render=""italic"">Blues Access</title> magazine.

 John and Leni Sinclair were married June 12, 1965. They have two daughters, Marion Sunny Sinclair, born May 4, 1967, and Celia Sanchez Mao Sinclair, born January 17, 1970.

Clever Bald.",The finding aid is written in English,"The collection consists of photos of Thom and George Bender looking at a canvas from a series entitled, ""A Pictorial History of Pharmacy."" Also includes photos of Thom with F. Clever Bald.","Robert A. Thom was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on March 4, 1915. He later moved to Port Huron, Michigan, where he spent most of his youth, and briefly lived in Columbus, Ohio. Thom enrolled in the Columbus School of Fine Arts and also studied under Ukrainian-American artist Robert Brackman. After working in Port Huron, Mich., he moved to Detroit, in circa 1939-1940. Thom was employed by both the Detroit Edison Company as well as the Chevrolet Division of General Motors. By 1945, Thom was working as an independent artist. 

In circa 1948, pharmaceutical firm Parke, Davis &amp; Company commissioned Thom to create a series of paintings on select moments from the history of pharmacy. The series, referred to in the literature by various names but apparently entitled <title render=""italic"">A History of Pharmacy in Pictures</title>, was a collaborative effort between several individuals, including Dr. George Urdang (of the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy) and George A. Bender, a pharmacist and amateur historian at Parke-Davis. Thom ultimately created 40 oil paintings in this series that depicted select figures and moments from the history of pharmacy, including Dean Alford Benjamin Prescott of the University of Michigan’s School of Pharmacy. Bender assisted with the research and creation of the narrative explanations behind each work. Parke-Davis then commissioned Thom to create a similar series that focused on the history of medicine. This additional series, also referred to in the literature by various names but apparently entitled <title render=""italic"">A History of Medicine in Pictures</title>, consisted of 45 oil paintings and was completed in circa 1964. Bender once again provided explanatory text for each painting. 

The two series proved to be popular and Parke-Davis distributed reproductions of these paintings to doctors’ offices and pharmacies throughout the United States and Canada. The paintings also appeared in numerous printed works, including <title render=""italic"">Great Moments in Pharmacy</title> and <title render=""italic"">Great Moments in Medicine</title>. These books were authored by Bender and Parke-Davis and included reproductions of the series’ paintings. In 2007, Pfizer, Inc.—which had acquired the <title render=""italic"">A History of Medicine in Pictures</title> series—donated the paintings to the University of Michigan. 

Thom created several other paintings and painting series during his career. These included <title render=""italic"">A History of Michigan in Paintings</title>, a series of 25 paintings commissioned by the Michigan Bell Telephone Company. The director of the Michigan Historical Collections (later Bentley Historical Library), Frederick Clever Bald, collaborated with Thom on this project. Thom’s other series focused on several topics, including the history of Illinois, American technology, and wildlife. Other notable works produced by Thom include <title render=""italic"">Day of Bread</title>, a painting commissioned by the American Bakers Association and presented to President Richard Nixon, and another painting residing in the Baseball Hall of Fame (as of 2020) that shows Babe Ruth’s “Called Shot” in the World Series of 1932. 

In addition to his artistic endeavors, Thom contributed to the development of the Birmingham Bloomfield Art Association and served as its first president. He was a member of the New York Society of Illustrators and Detroit’s Scarab Club, an artist’s club, gallery, and studio.

After maintaining a gallery in Birmingham in the early 1970s, Thom moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and then Texas.

He moved westward to Detroit in 1819 and shortly thereafter joined General Lewis Cass as a clerk and assistant topographer in Cass' expedition among the Indian tribes of the upper Great Lakes and Mississippi River. The purpose of the expedition was partly scientific and partly to improve relations with the Indian tribes of the area. In 1821, Secretary of War Calhoun appointed Trowbridge as Indian agent with responsibility of accompanying chiefs and representatives of the Six Nations of New York state to Green Bay for the purpose of finding suitable lands where the Six Nations might resettle. As an agent and Indian negotiator, Trowbridge was becoming increasing proficient in the study of tribal dialects and the customs and traditions of the Indians of the area. With his acknowledged expertise on Indian affairs, Trowbridge was given further and varied assignments as Indian agent, translator and mediator.

 In 1825, Trowbridge began increasingly to devote himself to business pursuits such as banking, land development and sawmills. He also turned to politics, serving as mayor of Detroit in 1834 and running unsuccessfully for governor in 1837. Following Trowbridge's defeat, Governor Stevens T. Mason appointed him regent of the University of Michigan, where he served from 1839 until 1842. Business and civic pursuits engaged Trowbridge for the remainder of his life. He died April 3, 1883.

Also of note are his extensive files of artists that were of interest to him as well as his own papers and publications.

The researcher should note that many items in the collection overlap various series. As a result, researchers should—in addition to reviewing multiple series—be sure to look for the ""see also"" notes that help identify some of these overlaps. "," George Vargas was born in Texas to Mexican American parents and later moved to Michigan where he was raised and educated. Like many other working-class youths, Vargas grew up working in the agricultural fields and auto factories. He went on to attend the University of Michigan, where he studied under Dr. Diane Kirkpatrick in art history and Black artist and historian Jon Onye Lockard in fine arts. In 1976, while a graduate student, Vargas proposed a new course to be added to the American Culture Program to diversify its course offerings. This course, which he called “A Historical Perspective: The Chicano Aesthetic/ Muralismo—Its Origins and Mexican Influences,” was one of several courses proposed by students. As a result, the American Culture Program offered three new courses in 1977: “Native American Studies,” “The Chicano Experience,” and “The Black Experience.” Vargas ultimately earned three degrees from the University of Michigan: a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Film (BFA '74), Master of Arts in American Culture/Latino Studies (MA '76), and Ph.D. in American Culture/Art History/Latin American Studies in 1988. His dissertation is titled: ""Contemporary Latino Art in Michigan, the Midwest, and the Southwest."" According to one of his former students, UCLA Professor Charlene Villaseñor Black, Vargas was the first Chicano to receive a Ph.D. in art history from the university.

 Vargas has gone on to lead a fruitful career where he has held many titles, including: artist, muralist, author, art historian and Americanist, museum educator, teacher, lecturer, and arts administrator. In all of his work he continues to be an advocate for multi-cultural art. Vargas has instructed and lectured in various institutions such as the University of Texas at El Paso, Oakland University, the University of Michigan, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and Texas A&amp;M University, Kingsville. As an artist and administrator, he has been actively involved with a myriad of art exhibitions, galleries, and conferences across the country since the mid 1970s, especially in Texas and Michigan. He is particularly proud of the ""Artist of the Year"" award he was given at the 1993 National Council of La Raza Silver Anniversary Conference Art Show in Detroit. His art is also present in many private art collections, including the collection of the late Latino musician Tito Puente.
 
 As an author, Vargas has several publications including: ""Mago Gandara: A Woman Muralist at the Border"" (monograph, Inter-American and Border Studies, University of Texas at El Paso, 1995), ""Border Artists in the Contemporary El Paso Mural Movement: Painting the New Frontier,"" <title render=""italic"">Chicano Studies: Survey and Analysis</title> (ed.

Carla Blank, Crown Publishing, Oakland, California, 2003). He received an educational fellowship to study Jewish culture, religion, and art in Israel in 2002. In 2010, Vargas published ""Contemporary Chican&#64; Art: Color &amp; Culture for a New America."" He continues to be active in the fields of Chicano and Latino Art, among others.

The papers are organized into of five series: Personal; Chronological; Church Files, Military Files; and Black Canyon Monument.","Mark Thomas Warner was born February 10, 1889 in Monroe, Ohio. He attended Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio (1912-1915), Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio (1916-1918), and Xenia Theological Seminary in Xenia, Ohio (1915-1918) where he received his certification as a Presbyterian minister.

 Warner assumed the pastorate of the United Presbyterian Church in Montrose, Colorado in July 1918. He remained the pastor of that congregation throughout his life, except during the years that he served as a chaplain in the U.S. Army during World War II. As a pastor, he was also active in missionary activities, and in promoting the welfare of Native Americans in Colorado.

 Also active in promoting conservation, Warner was instrumental in having the Black Canyon region of Colorado declared a National Monument. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison River is located in western Colorado near the town of Montrose. The steep terrain and rocky rim area protected the Black Canyon from development during the 1800s. In 1928, an investigating committee headed by Warner, recommended that the Montrose Lions Club build a road to the canyon rim. The club began clearing ground in the Summer of 1929 while Warner campaigned to have the county aid in the road building activity.

 The road was completed in the Fall of 1930, but well before that Warner and his committee were beginning to petition the National Park Service requesting the canyon be designated a national monument. After being rejected several times, the committee petitioned again in the Spring of 1932. The new Park Service director expressed an interest and a study was begun of the area. In the Fall of 1932, the Depression forced the Lions Club to disband and Warner immediately began to lobby the Montrose Chamber Of Commerce for their active support of the monument proposal.

 The idea gained regional support in western Colorado. On the advice of Roger W. Toll of the Park Service, and with the assistance of local photographer Dexter Walker, Warner began to assemble information packets outlining the boundaries of the proposed monument and extolling its visual and geologic beauty. These packets were sent to members of the Park Service, Colorado's senators and representatives and other influential parties at the state and federal levels. Early in 1933, Colorado representative Edward T. Taylor became Warner's Washington advocate. He guided the petition through the Washington bureaucracy and by February 28, the Black Canyon Monument proclamation was approved. It was signed by President Hoover on March 22, 1933.

 Warner remained actively involved with the Black Canyon Monument, serving on the local committee which provided input regarding the ongoing developments to the park. He wrote numerous articles about the history of the region and in 1967, with the help of Dexter Walker, wrote ""Through The Black Canyon"", a short book about the history of the canyon and the creation of the monument.

 Mark Warner married Bertha Rich of Hamilton, Ohio on May 21, 1919. They had two children, Jeanne (born in 1922) and Robert (born in 1927).",10720; 10721; 10722; 10720,"Chaplains, Military.; Clergy; World War, 1939-1945; Chaplains, Military.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3152; 3193; 3142; 3187,Diaries.; Sermons.; Photographs.; Postcards.,aat; aat; aat; aat,3021; 1722; 3021; 1722,Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (Colo.); Colorado.; Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (Colo.); Colorado.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,591; 591; 591,"Warner, Mark T.

Weston. Included are smaller series of papers of his brother and father. The collection includes correspondence, topical files, business and legal papers, and photographs. Of note are materials concerning Michigan's exhibit at the World Fair in 1893 and papers concerning lumbering and land interests in Michigan and Wisconsin.","Isaac Mellen Weston was born April 20, 1845 in North Anson, Maine. The chronology of his life from those years in Maine until he established permanent residency in Michigan in 1867 gives the impression of a youth both restless and enterprising. He moved with his family to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1857. In 1862, he participated in the Little Crow Indian Campaign serving as a lieutenant with a Minnesota regiment. From 1863 to 1865, he attended the University of Michigan. From there, he was for a time a traveling correspondent for the Chicago Times. Later in 1865, he worked as military storekeeper at Fort Laramie, Dakota Territory. And, in 1866, he was managing editor of the Daily Union Vedette in Salt Lake City, Utah, an anti-Mormon, anti-Brigham Young newspaper.

 About this time, Weston's life took on greater permanence. In 1867, he became an associate with his father William Weston in the manufacture of lumber in Wisconsin and in Whitehall, a lumbering city, located in Muskegon County, Michigan. In 1877, he became cashier and manager of the First National Bank of Whitehall where his father was then president. Following the retirement of his father in 1879, Weston became the president of the bank. He later moved to Grand Rapids in 1881 where he worked as cashier of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank which he reorganized as the Fourth National Bank.

 Around this time too, Weston involved himself in local and state politics. In 1880, he was nominated for the office of state treasurer. He was treasurer of the Grand Rapids Board of Education from 1881 to 1883. He also served as a member of the Grand Rapids Board of Police and Fire Commissioners. And in 1888, he was elected mayor of the city on the Democratic ticket. Weston was an influential member of the state's Democratic structure. He was a member of the state executive committee for six years, party treasurer for four years, and party chairman also for four years. In 1888, Weston was elected as the first delegate-at-large from Michigan to attend the Democratic National Convention to be held in St. Louis, Missouri. The nominee of this convention, Grover Cleveland, later appointed Weston to be a government commissioner with responsibility to examine, for acceptance, the portion of the Southern Pacific Railroad between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.

 In 1893, Weston was president of the Board of World's Fair Managers for Michigan. In this capacity, Weston had the responsibility for approving and overseeing all of the exhibits from Michigan to be displayed at the Columbian Exposition.

 Up until the time of his death, Weston led a full and varied life. He was president of a political organization known as the Association of the Northwest. In 1890, he helped to purchase and manage the Grand Rapids Democrat, one of the city's newspapers. He was a member of the Peninsular Club, member and president of O-Wash-Ta-Nong Boat Club, and member resident of the Detroit Club. Weston never married. He died December 10, 1898 in New York City and is buried in North Anson, Maine.",10807; 6832; 8606; 6831; 10808; 5546; 5547; 3626; 4874,Lumbering; Lumbering; American newspapers; Logging; Logging; Clubhouses; Clubs.; Lumber industry.; Sailboats.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3142; 3140,Photographs.; Scrapbooks.,aat; aat,1105; 807; 1866; 728; 1840,Grand Rapids (Mich.); Michigan; Wisconsin.; Grand Rapids (Mich.); Grand River (Mich.),lcsh; local; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh,5950; 5950; 5950; 4333; 8613,"Weston, Isaac M.

Barbeau was a prominent merchant and community leader in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, during the nineteenth century. He was born June 29, 1800, in LaPrairie, Quebec, and died in the Sault on October 17, 1882.

 Barbeau reputedly arrived in the Sault in 1817. He was initially employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, but eventually entered the service of John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. After a tenure of company service in Baraboo, Wisconsin, he re-settled in Sault Ste. Marie in 1834. In the same year he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at Mackinac, and indentured as a clerk under Gabriel Franchere (factor of the American Fur Company).

 Barbeau continued in the employ of this company until 1842, when, after being refused an increase in salary, he resigned his position to embark upon his own commercial endeavors. He eventually opened a general store and trading post in Sault Ste. Marie and organized an extensive fishery on Lake Superior.

 Archange LaLonde of the Sault and Barbeau were married around 1831. Two of three daughters survived to marry prominent area merchants. Henrietta married Myron W. Scranton, who purchased Barbeau's store in 1864. Flavia married James Pendill of Marquette, who had established a major sawmill west of the Sault as early as 1834.

 In addition to Barbeau's commercial interests, he maintained an active career in civic affairs. He became a county commissioner in 1838. He was elected to the state legislature in 1842, and Register of Deeds in 1845. The following year he secured a county judgeship. In 1849 and again in 1879 he was elected village president of Sault Ste. Marie.

 Barbeau was an early and effective advocate of the first shipping lock at Sault Ste. Marie, and when the second lock was opened in 1872, he presided over the dedication ceremonies.

 During his years of residency in the Upper Peninsula, Barbeau acquired extensive holdings of property in the area. A log house at the corner of Barbeau Lane and Water Street served as the first Barbeau home and remained in the family until 1895. He purchased and resided in the former Indian Agency house, previously the residence of Henry Schoolcraft. He owned and took possession of Chippewa Street, which was later changed to Barbeau. The settlement of Barbeau, its post office and Barbeau Point were named after him. Bass Lodge, built on Neebish Island ca. 1850, remained in the family until 1873. He also operated trading posts at Grand Marais and LaPointe on Lake Superior.",6137; 5842; 6138; 6139; 6130; 6140; 6141; 6142; 6143; 6144,Bridges.; Business records.; Fishing; Fur trade; Indians of North America; Lighthouses; Logging; Lumbering; Mines and mineral resources; Shipping,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,,,,999; 950; 1000; 939; 937; 1001; 910,Chippewa County (Mich.); Mackinac Island (Mich.); Marquette (Mich.); Upper Peninsula (Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie (Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie Canal (Mich.); United States,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,1980; 1980; 8972; 6390; 3764; 8003; 2993; 8691; 3465; 5643; 2604; 5791; 2406; 6468; 2138; 6102; 6775; 3315; 1392,"Barbeau, Peter.; Barbeau, Peter.; Burt, Hiram Austin, 1839-; Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865; Moore, William P., 1787-1850; Pendill, James, 1812-1885; Scranton, William Warren, 1917-2013; Trowbridge, L.

Much of the trust money went to the University of Michigan to be used for a building for the graduate school and an endowment to be used for different kinds of research. The Fund also awarded grants to agencies involved in child welfare, community culture, education, health, philanthropy, and science. The Fund distributed money from 1934 until about 1941. The series in this record group consist of administrative and executive files, and project applications and grant files.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The records of the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund document the continuing generosity of Horace Rackham and Mary Rackham to numerous charitable, educational, and scientific organizations and causes. The records contain the files of the Fund's trustees and directors and provide insight and information about such topics as the administration of a philanthropic fund-giving organization during the mid-1930s, the kinds of gifts made, the relationship among the Fund's trustees and officers, and the relationship between the Fund and the grant recipients. Because of the size of the gift, most of the documentation within the record group details the close ties between the Fund and the University of Michigan. These files concern not only the establishment of the Rackham endowment to the University, but also the different scientific and educational grants made. Additionally, these files detail the construction of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies building in Ann Arbor and the Rackham Educational Memorial building in Detroit.

 The records of the Fund cover the period of 1929-1950 though they bulk largest for the period of the Fund's greatest activity, 1934-1940. The record group has been separated into two series: Combined Administrative and Executive Office Files and Project applications/grants.","The Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund was the agency created in 1934 to administer the terms of the trust created by the last will and testament of Horace H. Rackham. Under Article II of the articles of incorporation, the Fund was to ""effectually carry out and administer the benevolent, charitable, educational, and scientific trust created by Horace H. Rackham to promote the health, welfare, happiness, education, training, and development of men, women and children, particularly the sick, aged, young, erring, poor, crippled, helpless, handicapped, unfortunate and under-privileged, regardless of race, in the world ....""

 Accordingly, the trustees of the Fund, working conscientiously over the next six years to fulfill the terms of the trust, funded an extraordinary number of projects that they believed Rackham himself would have supported. In practice, their support divides into three areas: charity and benevolence, education, and science.

 The estate which the Fund was to administer was estimated at around 10 million dollars. The trustees and officers of the Fund were Mrs. Mary A. Rackham (honorary president), Bryson D. Horton (chairman and treasurer), Arthur J. Lacy (president), Mrs. Myra H. Bussey (vice-president), Clarence E. Wilcox (secretary), and Dr. Mark S. Knapp (director). Lacy's term as president was cut short when he decided to become a candidate for governor in 1935. Mrs. Rackham was anxious about the publicity that might accrue to the Fund because of Lacy's candidacy and requested his resignation. He was succeeded as president by Frederick Rolland.

 The work of investigating potential areas and recipients of support and distributing money was handled out of an Ann Arbor office which the Fund referred to as the executive office. All programs of course had to be approved by the five trustees. The director's office was originally located in the Nickels Arcade, but later moved in 1936 to a room in Angell Hall, a building at the University of Michigan, and then to the Rackham Building following its completion. Within the executive office, the Fund's director administered daily operations, undertook investigations of prospective recipients, and communicated back to the Fund's trustees. The fund's first director, Dr. Mark Knapp, resigned in 1936 and was succeeded by Mrs. Mary Clark. Knapp's area of specialty was medical research. His successor, Clark was a tireless worker who seemed to have a close relationship to Mrs. Rackham based upon the frequency of their correspondence.

 The administrative offices of the Fund were located in Detroit in the Dime Bank Building. Here Bryson D. Horton who had assumed the office of Fund secretary dealt with financial problems pertaining to the administration of the Rackham estate, probate matters, and related issues. The Rackham estate was large and complicated and Horton was continually dealing with matters of bonds, property, and other investments. The Fund secretary also counseled the Ann Arbor office on problems relating to the distribution of funds.

 There were many recipients of the Rackham estate but without question the biggest beneficiary was the University of Michigan. During his lifetime, Horace H. Rackham was a generous donor to the university. With his passing, President Ruthven and other university officials opened negotiations with the trustees of the Rackham Fund arguing that a major gift to the university would fulfill Horace Rackham's wish that his wealth be used for research and educational purposes. President Ruthven proposed a gift of $5 million dollars to be used for the building and endowment of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. In 1935, the trustees agreed to the proposal, and in fact added 1.5 million to the 1 million originally suggested for the construction of the Rackham Building. In the next five years, the Fund or Mary Rackham personally donated funding for different university projects, principally a 1 million dollar gift in 1936 from Mary Rackham to establish the Institute for Human Adjustment and another million in 1937 from the Fund to establish the Rackham Arthritis Research Fund. In all from 1935 to 1936, the Rackham Fund and Mary Rackham personally gave nearly $12 million dollars to the University of Michigan.

Included are copies of letters from Chippewa Indian chiefs appealing to the President of the United States to honor its past treaties with the Indians. There are also many letters describing the copper deposits of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, including letters to copper mining companies (i.e. the Native Copper Association and the Bruce Mining Company) urging them to exploit the natural resources of the Upper Peninsula. Letters to Henry Schoolcraft, Johnston's brother-in-law, indicate something of his interest in Michigan's copper resources. Of interest are the series of letters written to Secretary of War, Lewis Cass, Henry R. Schoolcraft, and H.C. Gilbert defending his claim to receive land under the treaty of 1855. Johnston addressed letters to the following individuals: Lewis Cass, Zachariah Chandler, Peter Dougherty, Bishop Samuel McCoskry, Robert McClelland, Henry R. Schoolcraft, Charles Stuart, and C.C. Trowbridge.","George Johnston (also spelled Johnson) was the son of John Johnston, an Irish immigrant and O-Shau-gus-co-day-way-gua, a Chippewa Indian woman. In 1826, he was a sub-Indian agent at LaPointe, Wisconsin; later in 1835, he was appointed by the then Secretary of War Lewis Cass to survey the northern Michigan boundary between the Sioux and Chippewa Indians. In 1854, Johnston served as U.S. Indian Agent for the United States-Chippewa Indian Treaty of August 2, 1855. By this treaty, those Chippewa Indians of mixed blood were to receive eighty acres of land. Although Johnston qualified under this provision of the treaty, the Indian agent at Detroit, H.C.

The collection includes extensive correspondence with many of the country's leading architects, most notably members of the ""Chicago School,"" and architectural educators, and manuscript and photographic documentation resulting from Lorch's involvement with the Michigan Historic Buildings Survey and various restoration projects, including Mackinac Island.","Emil Lorch was born in Detroit of German-American parentage on July 21, 1870. He attended schools in Detroit, including the Detroit Museum of Art School, then went to work for the city's architectural offices. He next studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1890-1892, then returned to Detroit where he worked and was active in art and museum circles, especially the Detroit School of Art where he taught from 1895 to 1898. He studied in Paris, 1898-1899, and then went to Chicago as general assistant to the director of the Chicago Art Institute, 1899-1901. He was also secretary of the Chicago School of Architecture.

 Lorch next attended Harvard University, 1901-1903, where he obtained his M.A. degree in architecture. From 1903 to 1906 he was assistant professor of architecture at Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. In the fall of 1906 he came to the University of Michigan to establish a department of architecture in the College of Engineering. Under his leadership, the department in 1931 was re-established as a separate College of Architecture within the university with Lorch appointed as its first dean.

 Lorch was both a teacher and a practicing architect. He designed the Architecture Building at the University of Michigan, the Belle Isle Bridge in Detroit, and the residence of Alex Dow in Barton Hills. He was also professionally involved. Lorch served on the Committee on Education of the American Institute of Architects and was active in the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and the Michigan Society of Architects. During his career, Lorch corresponded with all the leading figures in academic architectural education, including Roy Jones, Warren P. Laird., and J. B. Robinson. He also was a leading figure in the movement for licensing architects in Michigan, 1915-1917, and served nationally in this movement through the 1930s via the A.I.A.'s Committee on Registration.

 After his retirement from the university in July 1940, Lorch devoted himself almost entirely to preserving Michigan's historic buildings. This interest had been fired originally by the Historic American Buildings Survey of the 1930s on whose advisory committee he served and whose records (Midwest District) form a part of this collection. He was active in the restoration projects of Mackinac Island and other early Michigan forts; and he cataloged and collected information and pictures about hundreds of historic and contemporary Michigan structures.

 Lorch died June 20, 1963.",6324; 5890; 5903; 7147; 5769; 3829; 3720; 3828; 4473; 3909; 3968; 3957; 3751; 4105,"Architects.; Architecture.; Dormitories; Historic buildings; World War, 1914-1918.; Architecture.; Barns.; Buildings.; Business enterprises.; Churches.; Courthouses.; Dwellings.; Hotels and taverns.; Log cabins.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3177; 3476; 3142,Architectural drawings.; Paintings.; Photographs.,aat; gmgpc; aat,850; 1410; 1122; 950; 1032; 2227; 1033; 850; 2228; 935; 1041; 1043; 1491; 1485; 889; 1447; 1054; 1057; 1060; 1062; 1065; 1582; 2229; 895; 994; 955; 1380; 2230; 1016; 2231; 2232; 2233; 1086; 2234; 1093; 1729; 1025; 894; 1095; 1102; 1480; 1105; 1786; 1109; 1110; 976; 1356; 1116; 1790; 1121; 1122; 1131; 1135; 1136; 981; 2235; 1143; 1144; 1008; 950; 1156; 1157; 866; 1159; 1000; 1162; 983; 1167; 1170; 1173; 1174; 1180; 1182; 1192; 2236; 1199; 1200; 1205; 1207; 2237; 2174; 1209; 1218; 2238; 1220; 1221; 1224; 2239; 1226; 1810; 937; 1229; 2240; 908; 1235; 2241; 1241; 1636; 1249; 2242; 1258; 2243; 1002,"Ann Arbor (Mich.); Belle Isle (Detroit, Mich.); Holland (Mich.); Mackinac Island (Mich.); Albion (Calhoun County, Mich.); Algonac (Mich.); Allegan (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Ann Arbor (Mich.); Battle Creek (Mich.); Bay City (Mich.); Benton Harbor (Mich.); Berrien Springs (Mich.); Blissfield (Mich.); Bloomfield Hills (Mich.); Buchanan (Mich.); Cambridge Junction (Mich.); Cassopolis (Mich.); Charlevoix (Mich.); Chelsea (Mich.); Climax (Mich.); Clinton (Mich.); Coloma (Mich.); Concord (Mich.); Constantine (Mich.); Dearborn (Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Detroit (Mich.); Dexter (Mich.); Dixboro (Mich.); Drayton Plains (Mich.); East Grand Rapids (Mich.); East Lansing (Mich.); Eastmanville (Mich.); Farmington (Mich.); Fayette (Mich.); Fenton (Mich.); Flint (Mich.); Fort Wilkins (Mich.); Goodrich (Mich.); Grand Island (Alger County, Mich.); Grand Rapids (Mich.); Grass Lake (Mich.); Grindstone City (Mich.); Grosse Ile (Mich.); Grosse Pointe (Mich.); Harbor Springs (Mich.); Hartland (Mich.); Highland Park (Mich.); Hillsdale (Mich.); Holland (Mich.); Irish Hills (Mich.); Ithaca (Mich.); Jonesville (Mich.); Kalamazoo (Mich.); Lamont (Mich.); Lansing (Mich.); Lapeer (Mich.); Mackinaw City (Mich.); Mackinac Island (Mich.); Macon (Mich.); Manchester (Mich.); Manistee (Mich.); Maple Rapids (Mich.); Marquette (Mich.); Marshall (Mich.); Mendon (Mich.); Monroe (Mich.); Mount Clemens (Mich.); Munising (Mich.); Muskegon (Mich.); Niles (Mich.); Northville (Mich.); Otsego (Mich.); Paris (Mich.); Paw Paw (Mich.); Petoskey (Mich.); Plainwell (Mich.); Pontiac (Mich.); Presque Isle (Mich.); Port Hope (Mich.); Port Huron (Mich.); Royal Oak (Mich.); Rushton (Mich.); Saginaw (Mich.); Saint Clair (Mich.); Saint Joseph (Mich.); Salem (Mich.); Saline (Mich.); Saugatuck (Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie (Mich.); Sharon (Mich.); South Lyon (Mich.); Spring Arbor (Mich.); Springville (Mich.); Sylvan Center (Mich.); Tecumseh (Mich.); Tipton (Mich.); Utica (Mich.); Washington (Mich.); White Pigeon (Mich.); Whitneyville (Mich.); Ypsilanti (Mich.)",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,4771; 4771; 1478; 2789; 4844; 5993; 5816; 3483; 7317; 2868; 4325; 5447; 5805; 8820; 3703; 7404; 8470; 242; 1049; 600; 1210; 3376; 1586; 8531; 2390; 1936; 7474; 3806; 6132; 3957; 7232; 2052; 7924; 3015; 6677; 8055; 5401; 3129; 6328; 7174; 6275; 5378; 5919; 63; 7045; 746; 8588; 101; 4435,"Lorch, Emil, 1870-1963; Lorch, Emil, 1870-1963; Mason, George DeWitt, 1856-; Angell, James Burrill, 1829-1916; Baldwin, Frank Conger, 1869-1945; Barbour, Levi L.

Volumes 1-51 and 78 to 87 (tract books for the Lower Peninsula) and the outsize folders (Lower Peninsula plat maps) are copies of earlier records made in 1894 for the Grayling Land Office. When that office was closed in 1898 the records were transferred to the Marquette Land Office. Volumes 52-77 and 88 (tract books for the Upper Peninsula) and volumes 150A-161 (plat maps for the Upper Peninsula) are the original records kept in the Marquette Land Office (originally in Sault Ste. Marie) beginning in 1847.

 The records were transferred to the General Land Office in Washington, D.C., when the Marquette Land Office was closed in 1925. In 1940, the Auditor General of Michigan, who was the chairman of the Michigan State Land Office Board, accepted the records for the state. (The State Land Office Board was established in 1937, and was not related to the Michigan State Land Office, which was abolished in 1914 and replaced by the Public Domain Commission.) Because of crowded conditions in the State Capitol, the Auditor General asked that the records be deposited in the Michigan Historical Collections, where they could be used by a WPA Writers Project study of the disposal of public lands in Michigan. They have been on deposit at this library since that time.","United States land offices were the agencies responsible for the sale of the public land to individual purchasers. The first land office in Michigan was established in Detroit in 1804, although no land sales were held until 1818. As sales expanded, additional offices were established in Monroe (1823), White Pigeon (1831), Ionia (1836), Flint (1836), Sault Ste. Marie (1847), and Duncan (1854). In 1888, after several of the offices had been moved or consolidated, the state was served by four land offices, in Detroit, East Saginaw, Reed City, and Marquette. In that year, the three Lower Peninsula offices were consolidated and moved to Grayling. In 1898, the Grayling office was closed and the Marquette office became responsible for the entire state.

The files provide personal information about campers and staff. The records are arrange in X series, Camper Files, Staff / Counselor Files and Administrative Files.","The site that is now Camp Al-Gon-Quian was originally a farm on Burt Lake in Northern Michigan, just east of Petoskey. In 1925, Herbert H. Twining purchased the land with the intent to start a summer camp. Twining was a University of Michigan graduate (1923), who initially wanted to be a medical doctor. However, an eye injury as a child prevented this and instead Twining pursued a profession that he found parallel: He dedicated his life's work to establishing Camp Al-Gon-Quian as a private boys' camp on the leading edge of camp programming.

 Twining chose the name Al-Gon-Quian because he believed that was a possible Native American expression for ""bow of a canoe."" Twining also borrowed several Indian names for the camper groups. He divided the campers into groups by age, grade, height and weight. Throughout the years, the tribes within the camp included the Ottawa, Chippewa, Cree, Ojibwa, Miami, Nipissing and Mississauga. One common element that joins these native tribes together is that they were a part of the Algonquian linguistic family and spoke Algonquian when together. Al-Gon-Quian is still the universal language for the children who spend their summers with us.

 In 1925, Mr. Twining opened camp for its first season. Sessions lasted 8 weeks, and boys came from all over Michigan and surrounding states. Prominent families from of the Ann Arbor community and the Midwest sent their sons to Camp Al-Gon-Quian. A brief list includes the Proctor &amp; Gamble sons of Cincinnati, the Wrigleys of Chicago, the Strohs of Detroit and Grosse Pointe, and the children of noteworthy University of Michigan figures Alvin Bentley, C.S. Mott and G. Mennen Williams. Prominent members of the university community that served as staff members include Bennie Oosterbaan, Dr. Roger Howell, Roscoe Bonisteel, E. Blythe Stason and James B. Edmonson.

 In addition to providing a fun outdoor experience for campers, Camp Al-Gon-Quian aimed to improve the character of young men. In 1932, the aims of camp were to develop strength of character, a purpose in life, a clear moral character, self-reliance and the ability to achieve. This was accomplished through two months of camaraderie and living in the great outdoors away from the stresses of city life. Campers often took an overnight train up north from Chicago or Detroit, spending their entire summers on Burt Lake.

 Twining was well-recognized in the camping community and actively involved with the American Camp Association, of which he was the first national president in 1935. He was the director of Al-Gon-Quian for 42 years until his retirement in 1967, when he sold camp to the Ann Arbor YMCA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,2424; 2424,"Camp Al-Gon-Quian (Burt Lake, Mich.); Camp Al-Gon-Quian (Burt Lake, Mich.)",lcnaf; lcnaf,,,

Includes administrative records of the Center, the Academy and the Camp and personal papers of Maddy, photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures.",The finding aid is written in English,"The records of the Interlochen Center for the Arts were received in installments over many years. They came from several sources: the Camp office in Ann Arbor, the Tremaine family, an alumni leader, and various administrators at Interlochen, but the greatest proportion was assembled from Maddy's home and Interlochen offices, after his death, by Margaret (Peg) Stace, his long-time assistant.

 The Camp files for 1935-1945 comprise the major portion received in their original order, and they were in disarray because of frequent changes in Camp secretaries and the practice of moving the office (along with relevant files) from Ann Arbor to Interlochen and back each summer. Also, Maddy kept many items of a personal and confidential nature at home.

 In processing the records, an attempt was made both to preserve the original order, where ascertainable, and to highlight major subjects and individuals, some of whose importance only became apparent with the passage of time. A separate name index is available for major correspondents. Where extant, explanatory historical and background information has been placed at the front of records categories. Because of Maddy's influence on the development of Interlochen both past and present, his correspondence with later administrators has been included if practical, under ""Administration"" in their papers.

 The surviving records have been divided into nine series: Chronological, Subject, Post-Maddy Administrators, Boards, Closed, Printed, Visual Materials, Sound Recordings, and Scrapbooks. The Chronological focuses on Maddy and the Camp until 1966 while the Subject, is composed of two subseries. The first, mainly 1928-1989, though also heavily relating to Maddy, also includes much on developments through the '90s. The second subseries, 1930-2003, Later Acquisition represents a group of files that were acquired in 2005. Many files pertain to the early camp and Joesph Maddy. The Post-Maddy Administrators series begins in the late 1950's when Maddy expanded the staff in anticipation of making Interlochen a year-round institution and continues unto the most recent accession. Boards (governing bodies) starts with the Camp's founding in 1928 and ends in 1989 while the Closed series covers the Maddy, Haas, and Wilson administrations through 1971. Printed offers coverage to the present but is more complete for the early years through the 1980's. While the Visual Materials and Sound Recordings series extend from the 1920's into the 1980's, it offers best coverage from 1924 to 1942 Scrapbooks, with gaps in the early years, documents both Maddy and the Camp, beginning with the National High School Orchestra and ending with the Camp's 50th anniversary celebration in 1978.","Joseph Maddy, Interlochen's founder and long-time leader, was born in Wellington, Kansas, on October 21, 1891. Both his parents were educators. His father taught before becoming a banker, and his mother served as county school superintendent. Both also enjoyed performing music, especially his mother, an accomplished amateur musician. Their first son, Harry, a year and a half older, served as a role model in Joe's early musical career.

 As youths, the two brothers joined the newly formed Wellington Boys Band. Its director took the group on a musical camping trip, which Joe greatly enjoyed. Later, the boys graduated to the town band. They also performed in the family quartet, which was expanded during their early teens when another talented musical family, the Petits, moved to town. The Petits' youngest daughter, Fay, who years later eventually became Mrs. Joseph Maddy, and the two families spent part of a summer playing music while camping together.

 Since musical instruction was unavailable in the public schools, Joe Maddy, like his brother before him, dropped out of high school after his freshman year. Following two semesters at Bethany (Kansas) College of Music and Fine Arts, he transferred to the Wichita (Kansas) College of Music, which his brother attended. In 1909, having joined the musicians union, he again followed his brother, becoming the youngest member of the Minneapolis Symphony. Two years later, he married Marie Mangan, and in 1913, the first of their three children was born.

 While his brother remained for almost a half century as violinist with the Minneapolis Symphony, Joe, a violist, chaffed under the group's emphasis on seniority, rather than ability, for promotion. So in 1914, he switched to the new St. Paul Orchestra as Assistant Concertmaster.

 The economic disruptions of World War I brought a quick end to the St. Paul Orchestra and Maddy's symphonic career, leading him eventually into music education. For the next four years, he expanded his knowledge and skills in a variety of musical jobs. He became a clarinetist with a vaudeville orchestra in Peoria, Illinois. Then, he learned conducting as head of the orchestra in his native Wellington (Kansas). In 1915, he moved to Wichita Falls, Texas, as director of the College of Music and Art. There, he started a non-credit orchestra among high school students. Relocating to Chicago, he played saxophone in jazz clubs and taught in several music schools.

 In 1918, when philanthropist George Eastman created the position of superintendent of music in the Rochester, New York, public schools, Joe, because of his ability to play a variety of instruments, got the job. Although he lacked the required teaching certificate, the president of the University of Rochester, following a half hour interview, conferred the needed credential on him ""by examination."" During his two year tenure in Rochester, Maddy started school bands and orchestras which greatly impressed Eastman. Joe's efforts together with a follow-up survey by Pittsburgh music educator, Will Earhart, helped convince Eastman to endow the distinguished music school which bears his name.

 While preparing the Rochester survey, Earhart approached Maddy about becoming supervisor of school music and director of civic music in Richmond, Indiana, a position which Earhart once held. Maddy hesitated because the job included choral work, but Earhart persuaded him that a summer course at Chautauqua under T. P. Giddings, a specialist in mass choral instruction (and head of the public school music program in Minneapolis), would qualify him.

 The Chautauqua experience (1920) forged a strong bond between Maddy and Giddings. Almost immediately, they began collaborating on a master work of music instruction. Shunned initially by publishers because it contained familiar, and thus works which could not be copyrighted, it found a champion in Carl D. Greenleaf, head of C. G. Conn Company, the instrument manufacturer. Published initially by Conn in 1922, the <title render=""italic"">Universal Teacher</title> became the standard in the field, presenting the first practical system for teaching all instruments of the band and orchestra at the same time.

 During Maddy's four years in Richmond, he scored a major breakthrough by getting music accepted into the regular school curriculum with credit toward graduation. He also developed the first complete high school symphony orchestra, which, in 1922, performed before the Music Supervisors (soon renamed Educators) National Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. In preparing for the trip, Maddy initiated another major reform. Remembering his frustration with the Minneapolis Symphony, he instituted weekly challenges for position determined by the votes of orchestra members. Following four months of intensive study, Maddy passed the subject examinations for a high school diploma, and he also began teaching part-time at Earlham College in Richmond.

 In 1924, Maddy accepted a joint appointment as supervisor of music in the Ann Arbor, Michigan, public schools and head of the school music department in the University School of Music, which was affiliated with but separate from the University of Michigan. At first, he devoted most of his energies to developing the public school music program, organizing the high school band and other musical groups (where, previously, there had been only a mandolin club). By the fall of 1927, he switched totally to the conservatory, where he initiated the first conducting classes.

 A few months before moving to Ann Arbor (1924), Maddy was named a member of the new Instrumental Affairs Committee of the Music Supervisors National Conference. The committee, with gifts from the National Bureau for the Advancement of Music, headed by C. M. Tremaine, funded band and orchestra contests on both the state and national levels. In 1926, Maddy became its chairman, and with assistance from Giddings, organized the first National High School Symphony Orchestra, composed of outstanding young musicians from throughout America. Its performance at the Music Supervisors National Conference in Detroit led to an invitation to assemble a similar group for the national convention of school superintendents in Dallas, Texas, the following spring.

 The performance of the second National High School Orchestra (1927) led the superintendents to adopt a resolution that music receive ""equal consideration and support with other basic subjects"" in the public schools. An elated Joe Maddy, at a farewell party for orchestra members, promised to find them a permanent home, a summer camp where they could play music ""all day long.""

 Returning to Ann Arbor, he placed an advertisement in the Sunday <title render=""italic"">Detroit Free Press</title> seeking a location for his proposed camp. Willis Pennington, owner of a resort hotel near Interlochen in northern Michigan, responded. He had vacant property close to a railroad station and to separate boys and girls camps owned by his family. After an inspection trip, Maddy and Giddings arranged a deal to board campers at the hotel in exchange for some land between the lakes. Tremaine, who served as their financial advisor, finalized the agreement in his office.

 With a loan from band instrument manufacturers plus a personal gift from Greenleaf and additional funds from Traverse City bankers, construction of the camp began. It opened on schedule, June 24, 1928, as the home of the National High School Orchestra. Representing a pioneering venture in both musical and coeducational camping, it became the first truly independent, non-college, summer camp devoted strictly to music and probably the first to incorporate male and female campers on an equal basis. From the beginning, it also accepted members of all religions, rather than following the exclusionary practices of the time. While a strong Southern constituency delayed admission of African Americans, it became a leader in the post World War II integration of private camps, producing many distinguished black alumni, including Jessye Norman.

 The first year of the National High School Orchestra Camp proved an artistic success, but a financial disaster. Ending $40,000 in the red, Maddy sold debenture bonds among supporters and area residents to meet the deficit. To protect the creditors, a Board of Control was formed to oversee the Camp's finances. It consisted of Maddy, Giddings, and Tremaine plus four creditor representatives (Pennington and three debenture holders).

 When the Camp opened for its second year, it added an alumni or college division and featured band as well as orchestra training. Shortly thereafter, with the Depression effectively ending funds for the National High School Orchestra, the Camp began to advertise itself simply as ""The National Music Camp.""

 Despite a doubling of enrollment in its second year, the deficit remained and became more of a problem with the onset of the Depression. The sale of nationwide broadcast rights in 1930 helped keep the Camp open. Two years later, Maddy secured enough in gifts and new debentures to make a down payment on purchasing the Camp, but within another year, it faced immanent bankruptcy. Tremaine, the treasurer, saved the Camp by persuading Pennington and the debenture holders to accept a reduction in their payments and by instituting rigid financial controls on Maddy's spending.

 Although the Camp struggled financially, it continued to gain fame musically. In 1930, its orchestra performed in Washington, D.C., before President Herbert Hoover with Senator Arthur Vandenberg's daughter as soloist. Three years later, it played at the Century of Progress in Chicago. In 1937, an affiliation with Illinois State Normal University guaranteed college credit to members of its alumni division, and two years later, its orchestra appeared at the World's Fair in New York, conducted by nine year old child protégé, Loren Maazel. Early campers included Frederick Fennell and Seymour Lipkin, and guest artists and faculty: John Philip Sousa, Frederick Stock, Ferde Grofe, Percy Grainger, and Howard Hanson.

 Despite Maddy's success, his preoccupation with the Camp created problems at the University School of Music where he taught. Although the School became a unit of the University of Michigan in 1929, it remained at first under the control of the University Musical Society. Charles A. Sink, head of the Society, grew increasingly critical of the time Maddy devoted to the Camp, rather than the School.

 In 1930, the newly installed president of the University, Alexander Grant Ruthven, came to Maddy's rescue. Using funds from a Carnegie Foundation grant, he released Maddy from teaching for five years with instructions to promote music education as he saw fit.

 Following Ruthven's mandate, Maddy experimented with the use of radio for music instruction. In 1931, under the aegis of the U. of M. Broadcasting Service, he started band and orchestra classes over a statewide network via WJR in Detroit. Eventually, they were expanded to include string and vocal instruction and a popular hymn program. In 1936, NBC picked up his band and orchestra classes on its national network. In Maddy's radio work, he relied heavily on University of Michigan students. They included announcers Mike Wallace (Myron Wallach) for the instructional and Camp broadcasts and Ward Quaal for the hymn program and technician Jerome Wiesner (later president of MIT), who also helped found the radio workshop at the Camp.

 The same year (1936) as Maddy began his national broadcasts, he assumed the presidency of the Music Educators National Conference (MENC). Not surprisingly, educational broadcasting served as the theme of his inaugural address. Upon completion of his two-year term, he became director (1938-1940) of the MENC program, ""Music and American Youth,"" which featured broadcasts of school music groups throughout the United States.

 In addition to his radio work, Maddy, under the sponsorship of the university Extension Service, served as conductor for all-state, regional, and national high school orchestras and supervised state and national school band and orchestra contests and festivals. Often, he arranged his appearances in conjunction with his broadcasts, and everywhere he recruited students for the Camp.

 Despite the successes, Maddy and the Camp experienced a series of crises at the end of the 1930's. Maddy's first marriage disintegrated, and he and Giddings battled over control of Interlochen. Meanwhile, Camp finances remained tight, and the expiration of Maddy's Carnegie grant at the university brought him into renewed conflict with the head of the University Musical Society. Finally, in 1939, NBC, given the growing commercial demand for air time, canceled his nationwide instructional program.

 In 1937, Maddy divorced his first wife, Marie, who served as Interlochen's secretary. His remarriage a year later to his childhood friend, Fay Petit, a professional musician, restored happiness to his personal life, but the problem with Giddings remained.

 Facing imminent retirement from the Minneapolis school system, Giddings opposed Maddy over the choice of Camp director and university affiliation. In order to force a settlement, Tremaine, who supported Maddy, threatened to resign. The tactic worked; the crisis passed, and amiable relations were restored (lasting until Giddings' death in 1954). Thereafter, Maddy, though occasionally restrained in fiscal policy by Tremaine and the Board of Trustees, lacked a serious rival in operating the Camp.

 The easing of the Depression and a Hollywood movie contract, resulting in Paramount Pictures <title render=""italic"">There's Magic in Music</title> (1940), finally brought prosperity to the Camp. At the end of the 1941 season, Pennington exchanged the deed to the property for a mortgage on the amount due. Two years later, the mortgage was retired, and in another year, the debentures paid. The Camp also expanded, purchasing Camp Penn Loch (the new Junior Camp for Boys) in 1942 and Interlochen (the new Junior Girls Camp) in 1944 from members of the Pennington family.

 Maddy's situation at the University of Michigan also improved. Early in 1940, Ruthven named Maddy acting director of Broadcasting Service, and soon afterward, the university took full control of the School of Music from the Musical Society. The new dean, Earl V. Moore, supported Maddy's work at the Camp. In 1942, when the contract with Illinois State University expired, the U. of M. assumed responsibility for the college division, and a year later, transferred its summer All-State high school program to Interlochen.

 After the reduction in Maddy's instructional broadcasts, he turned to the civic orchestra movement as a means of utilizing graduates of his programs. In the fall of 1939, he surveyed civic music directors throughout the country, and the following summer, he convened a meeting at the Camp to discuss ""mutual problems."" Within a year, he assumed leadership of the Ann Arbor Civic (Symphony) Orchestra, and working for the U. of M. Extension Service, formed the Michigan Civic Orchestra Association to promote mass orchestra performances.

 When America entered World War II, Governor Murray Van Wagoner appointed Maddy head of Michigan's Wartime Civic Music program to promote the war effort. As usual, Maddy based many of his activities at the Camp. In 1942, he held the organizing conference there, and the following year, a Clinic for civic music directors. Despite a battle with publishers over copyright, his group produced a patriotic songbook for general use. With university backing, he also led musical performances throughout the state and broadcast patriotic music over a network of Michigan stations fed by WJR in Detroit.

 Just as the outlook for Maddy and the Camp improved, they suffered a double blow. The introduction of wartime restrictions threatened Camp operations. Then, in July 1942, James Petrillo, the new head of the American Federation of Musicians, forced NBC to cancel its broadcasts from Interlochen (after thirteen years), citing a threat to union jobs. While the Camp struggled with rationing, travel restrictions, and the virtual disappearance of college-age men, Maddy worked to remove the limitations on his own and the Camp broadcasts.

 His efforts were two-fold: (1) to develop an alternative radio network, which ultimately, he decided, should use the new FM technology, and (2) to secure national legislation prohibiting union interference with student performances. NBC's cancellation of his instructional program convinced him that educators needed to create their own broadcasting network. In the late 1930's and early 1940's, he began soliciting support for such a project from state officials and leading educators.

 By early 1944, with FM technology presenting a viable alternative, he secured the backing of President Ruthven to travel throughout southern Michigan in support of his proposal. His efforts led to the formation of the Michigan Educational Radio Association to plan FM broadcasting in the state, and in 1945, he became chairman of the new Michigan Community Radio Commission. Only the lack of sufficient state funding prevented the immediate implementation of his plan, which eventually led the University of Michigan to establish its own FM station (1948).

 While Maddy labored to create an educational network, he succeeded in restoring Camp performances to the airwaves on a limited basis. In 1943, Michigan State College's new station (initially, AM) and Traverse City's WCTM resumed broadcasting from the Camp. As with his instructional programs, he also experimented with recordings to widen his audience. Eventually, they replaced live performances for broadcast, especially on the growing numbers of FM educational stations.

 In attempting to secure legislation against Petrillo, Maddy relied heavily on former Camper father and friend, Senator Arthur Vandenberg. The issue was complicated by union efforts to secure compensation for recordings played on commercial radio. By January 1945, when Maddy appeared on the verge of success, Petrillo retaliated by putting the Camp on the American Federation of Musicians' ""Unfair List"", banning members from teaching or performing at Interlochen. A year later, shortly before Congress enacted relief legislation, Maddy was dismissed from the union for violating the ban.

 While the Lea Act (1946) forbade restrictions on noncommercial broadcasts, Petrillo, through legal wrangling and skillful use of the ""Unfair List,"" was able to circumvent it. In 1947, he reached a compromise with the leadership of the Music Educators National Conference. Under it, Petrillo waived all objections to performances by school groups, but by defining the Camp as a profit-making organization, he continued to limit its broadcasts. For over a decade, until Petrillo retired, the union ban remained in effect.

 Despite the limitation, the Camp prospered. Publicity about Petrillo's actions attracted both students and donors. During the height of the controversy, Camp enrollment doubled, and Maddy began obtaining significant financial contributions from business leaders. In 1944, retailer S.S. Kresge, Jr., made the first of several substantial gifts to the Camp. Other donors followed, often attracted by Maddy's stand against unionization or the Camp's principles of free competition.

 Although Maddy sought to end European dominance of American classical music, his success inevitably led him into international involvement. Early in 1940, he participated in the selection of a National Youth Administration orchestra to tour Latin America. Shortly thereafter, his old friend, Will Earhart, appointed him to the new State Department advisory committee on Inter-American Music. In his acceptance remarks, Maddy emphasized that music afforded the best means to overcome the language barrier. During the war, he encouraged Latin American music leaders to visit Interlochen and solicited support for their students as Campers. At the end of the conflict, he urged funding for a good will tour of Mexico by a high school orchestra.

 Like his friend Vandenberg, the war convinced Maddy of the need for international cooperation, and he became a supporter of the United Nations. In 1946, under his direction, the student council at Camp adopted a ""Charter for Youth,"" which set forth principles of world unity. Two years later, he dedicated Kresge Auditorium, the Camp's new performance center, ""to the promotion of World Friendship through the Universal Language of the Arts.""

 When a mid-fifties thaw in the Cold War created opportunities for cultural exchange, Maddy lobbied the federal government for a Camp orchestra tour of Eastern Europe. Government, he argued, should aid groups of young amateurs, the world's future leaders, as it did the professionals. Having failed to secure federal assistance, he devoted the Camp's own resources to attracting foreign educators and students. Eventually, in 1964, he started the International (later World) Youth Symphony, composed of Campers from many nations, and two years later, arranged for the Camp to host the first meeting in America of the International Society of Music Educators.

 Maddy and the Camp emerged from World War II in excellent condition. While Maddy was secure at the university, the Camp was successful both financially and artistically. Because of the Camp's growing prosperity, Maddy was able to reduce his university appointment to part-time and devote even more of his energies to Interlochen's development.

 As the waiting list for Campers lengthened, he launched a vigorous program for new facilities and increased enrollment. In 1947, in order to better deal with the increased numbers, the Junior Division was split into Juniors (grades 3-6) and Intermediates (grades 7-9). Two years later, the All-State Piano Institute became the first of what were to be many post-camp programs for adults, and Maddy began to winterize new and existing buildings, so they could be used during colder weather. In the 1950's, loans from the University of Michigan helped considerably in Camp expansion.

 During the two decades following the war, the Camp grew from 155 buildings to 400, from 500 acres to 1,200, and from 900 Campers to 3,000. Although the union effectively barred professional musicians, music educators filled the void, and the Camp continued to produce first-rate alumni, who occupied leading positions with symphonies, opera and dance companies, and in other areas of contemporary life, both inside the arts and out.

 Amidst its growth, the Camp had to defeat threats from local boosters intent on developing the area economically. In 1953, Maddy thwarted a proposed state prison camp, and two years later, a federal air force base. The latter was vigorously promoted by Congresswoman Ruth Thompson of Whitehall, but Representatives Albert Engel of Lake City and Robert Griffin of Traverse City, both members of the Camp's Advisory Board, came to its defense.

 As the Camp grew, Maddy began to dream of making it a year-round institution for artistically talented youth. He envisioned a boarding high school and, eventually, a university that would provide training in both academic and artistic subjects. In planning the curriculum for the school, he relied heavily on Camp Advisory Board member, Martin ten Hoor, a former University of Michigan professor, now a dean at the University of Alabama.

 Nearing mandatory retirement from the university, Maddy initiated a major campaign to fulfill his dream. He added permanent staff, expanded facilities, and increased fund-raising efforts. On November 8, 1956, an alarmed Tremaine, in anticipation of his own imminent retirement as Camp Treasurer, wrote the Trustees a cautionary letter, based on his long experience with Camp finances. While he praised Maddy's vision and perseverance, he warned that Maddy's ambition needed to be restrained lest it put the institution in a precarious financial position as it had earlier.

 Despite Tremaine's admonition, Maddy proceeded with his expansion plans. Prior to 1956, the permanent staff consisted only of himself and a secretary (Peg Stace since 1941). He began the expansion by appointing Roger Jacobi as Camp Secretary and Director of Personnel (succeeded three years later by John A. Merrill). In 1957, he named George Wilson Vice President for Camp Operations, and in another year, Don Gillis, a composer and member of the musicians union, Director of Development. In part because of the Trustees' desire to groom a successor, Gillis received manifold responsibilities: to achieve a reconciliation with the new head of the musicians union, to direct the Camp's fledgling American Opera program, to oversee the Interlochen Press (which Maddy started in 1957 in hopes of generating income), to assist with expansion of the broadcast program, and perhaps most importantly, to aid in fund-raising.

 With Gillis' assistance, the dispute with the musicians union was quickly resolved, and in March 1959, the Camp was removed from its ""Unfair List."" Two years later, NBC broadcasts, now called ""The Best from Interlochen,"" resumed on tape. The same summer, Maddy scored a major coup by enticing the young international award-winning pianist, Van Cliburn, to make the first of several appearances at Interlochen. Fund-raising went far less well, and in March 1961, Gillis submitted his resignation. Still, Maddy remained committed to converting the Camp into a year-round institution for youthful artists.

 In the fall of 1961, having formally retired from the university, Maddy moved the Camp office, over the objections of the permanent staff from Ann Arbor to Interlochen. Shortly thereafter, Norma Lee Browning Ogg, a <title render=""italic"">Chicago Tribune</title> writer and Camp publicist, introduced Maddy to Chicago insurance executive and philanthropist Clement Stone. The two hit it off immediately, and Stone agreed to fund Maddy's long-planned boarding school for high school students, the Interlochen Arts Academy. Almost immediately, Stone was appointed to the Board of Trustees, on which he remained a leading force for nearly two decades (becoming its chair upon Roscoe Bonisteel's death in July 1972).

 Within another year (1962), Maddy and the institutions he founded experienced more major triumphs. Van Cliburn again made a special appearance at the Camp, and in August, its dancers and orchestra performed for President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy on the White House lawn. The next month, the Interlochen Arts Academy, a major component of Maddy's dream, opened.

 The following year (1963) witnessed additional achievements. The ""Today"" Show made a special telecast from Interlochen; the institution's new FM station, WIAA, went on the air, and the Browning biography of Maddy appeared. In another year, the University of Michigan awarded Maddy an honorary doctorate. At the commencement ceremony, his fellow honoree, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, announced plans for a ""Great Society."" Shortly thereafter, the President's daughter, Lucy Baines Johnson, appeared at Interlochen as narrator for the National Youth Symphony performance of <title render=""italic"">Peter and the Wolf</title>, which Van Cliburn conducted. The summer ended triumphantly with the first Interlochen Arts Festival, featuring the new World Youth Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy.

 On April 18, 1966, as Interlochen prepared for the opening session of the International Society of Music Educators (whose participants included Norman Dello Joyo, Dimitri Kabalevsky, and Zoltan Kodaly), Joseph Maddy died suddenly. Until a successor could be chosen, the Board of Trustees appointed an Administrative Committee to oversee operations. Chaired by John Merrill (Secretary of the Board), its members included George Wilson (Director of the Camp), Thor Johnson (Director of the Academy), Clare Burns (Treasurer of Interlochen), and Margaret Stace (Maddy's long-time secretary, now Assistant to the President).

 Within a year, the Board selected national classical music broadcaster Karl Haas as Maddy's successor. Haas had worked with Maddy for several years as head of Interlochen's Advisory Board, which helped raise private funds. He also served as chair (with Maddy a member) of the Michigan Cultural Commission's music committee and the State Council for the Arts (created by Governor George Romney), which provided state assistance to Interlochen. In addition, the European born and educated Haas offered the strong international ties which Interlochen valued.

 As president, Haas announced his major goal would be to ""fulfill Joe Maddy's dreams,"" by securing funding for the proposed College of the Arts. To assist him, he named John Merrill Vice President for Administrative Affairs and Development. In 1968, a new institutional name, ""The Interlochen Center for the Arts,"" was adopted to cover the Camp, Academy, and proposed college.

 Despite great efforts, fund raising failed to fulfill expectations. The relationship between the Camp and Academy remained strained, and some Board members grew dissatisfied with student behavior (particularly at the Academy, where the new youth culture took hold). Changing tastes in music, especially among the young, and in family vacation patterns as well as the development of competing institutions, such as the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Michigan (which opened the summer following Maddy's death), threatened Interlochen's unchallenged preeminence. In November 1969, Merrill announced his acceptance of a development position at Northwestern University, and four months later, after a board meeting at which he outlined his proposals for Interlochen's future, Haas submitted his resignation.

 Until a permanent head could be chosen, George Wilson, who was nearing retirement as Camp director, agreed to serve as Interim President. A year later (1971), the Board named music educator and long-time Interlochen administrator and instructor Roger Jacobi to head the institution. Following his resignation in 1959 as Board secretary, Jacobi continued to teach summers at the Camp while holding a joint appointment with the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor public schools, much as Maddy once did. Then, in 1968, Jacobi became Assistant Dean of the Music School, in which capacity he served as Director of the Camp's University Division (Allen Britton and Paul Boylan, who held the post earlier and later, eventually became Deans of the Music School).

 During Jacobi's eighteen year presidency, he defused tensions inherent in the transition from the Maddy era and put the institution on a solid financial basis. Physical facilities were significantly improved, and for the first time, a major endowment was established. Interlochen continued to attract leading artists and to produce high quality graduates. It also served as the model (with George Wilson's assistance) for a similar music camp in the Philippines, and in 1975, hosted a visit by President and Mrs. Gerald Ford. On the eve of Jacobi's retirement, he discontinued (after the 1988 season) the University Division, an important tie to the University of Michigan for thirty-seven years.

 Jacobi's advance announcement of his intention to retire at age sixty-five gave the Trustees ample time to prepare for an orderly transition. In 1989, they chose Dean Boal, a distinguished college-level teacher and administrator and public broadcasting executive, to became the first Interlochen president who neither knew nor worked with Maddy. Prior to coming for his selection interview, Boal had only visited Interlochen once, and then, just briefly.

 Shortly after his appointment (1989), the National Music Camp was renamed ""the Interlochen Arts Camp,"" reflecting its incorporation into the larger institution and expansion beyond music. Despite a recession-induced cut in state funding, Boal kept the operation financially sound and oversaw the growth of the Academy and Camp to record enrollments. He also increased the scope of summer professional offerings, which attracted growing numbers of outsiders to the Camp. Like all of Maddy's successors, he faced the tensions inherent in trying to balance needed changes with valued traditions.

 Early in 1994, Boal announced his intention of taking early retirement as soon as a successor could be chosen. A year later, the trustees named youth educator Richard F. Odell, headmaster of the Chicago Academy for the Arts, to lead Interlochen into the twenty-first century. Like Boal, Odell lacked previous association with Maddy and the institution he founded.

 On becoming president, Odell spent much of his first year meeting with Interlochen supporters both on campus and throughout the country in order to define the institution's future goals. Then, he announced a major fund-raising program to renovate facilities and increase endowment, adding that he hoped to make Interochen better known both in its home area and beyond. In fact, during Odell's tenure, the camp was named one of the top ten camps in the country and the World Youth Symphony Orchestra performed in the Cultural Olympiad at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA.

 Odell was succeeded by Edward J. Downing. During Downing's time in office, Interlochen merged with The Pathfinder School, a local independent day school for pre-school through eighth-grade students. Downing retired in 2002 and was succeeded by Jeffery S. Kimpton in 2003.",8495; 8496; 8497; 8498; 8499; 4526; 4527; 4528,Music; Musicians; Radio and music; Radio broadcasting; Music camps; Music; Music camps; Musicians,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3413; 3142; 3477; 3140; 3144,Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Slides.; Scrapbooks.; Sound recordings.,lctgm; aat; gmgpc; aat; aat,2122; 2122,Interlochen (Mich.); Interlochen (Mich.),lcsh; lcsh,6358; 7220; 7694; 3270; 4790; 2147; 704; 9000; 6699; 8725; 5126; 7191; 1573; 545; 4192; 4783; 1784; 3629; 7538; 7220; 1353; 8710; 3690; 859; 2291; 7220; 3146; 2925,"Petrillo, James C.

The organization was incorporated in 1888 as the Order of the King's Daughters, and in 1891 the present name was adopted. The Michigan Branch was founded ca. 1896.

 The Order, which has branches in the United States and Canada, is an interdenominational service organization. Membership is open to anyone who shares the Order's aims and purposes and who professes him- or herself a Christian. The Order's purpose is to participate in, and support, religious, educational, and philanthropic endeavors while training individuals (both members and non-members alike) for leadership in Christian service. The Order's branches support ministries for the aging, the handicapped, and the underprivileged through homes, hospitals, youth camps, day care centers, scholarship programs and donation drives. In Michigan, for example, the Order founded and ran the Hospital School for children at the University of Michigan Hospital.

 Throughout its history, the Order has realized its goal of educating for Christian service by offering scholarships. One scholarship program provided financial aid for Native American students, overseas students, and students interested in training for the ministry and other forms of Christian service. A second scholarship program provided financial assistance for students in health sciences programs. A third financial aid program, the Chautauqua Scholarship Program, began in 1920 and provided funding for young adults who wished to participate in courses offered at the Order's own Chautauqua Institution. This institution offered ""self-enrichment"" and Christian leadership courses, and was housed in a compound consisting of a chapel, a Fellowship Hall, and three houses. The Chautauqua Institution accommodated forty-three students and a full staff.

 The basic unit of the Order is the circle, which generally consists of women in an individual church congregation. Circles are organized into county-wide branches, which are in turn organized into state-wide branches. The Order's official publication is the <title render=""italic"">Silver Cross Magazine</title>.

The collection is arranged mainly by unit or functional responsibility within the governor's office. These series are chief of staff/executive assistants, correspondence office, government relations, issues development, legal department, operators, personnel, press office, Upper Peninsula office, Washington office, Lansing residence, and political and campaign files. The files document the Blanchard administration's efforts in areas of education, job creation, the state's economy, environmental protection, and the rebuilding of Michigan's infrastructure.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","James J. Blanchard, as Governor of Michigan, was the chief executive of the state. He was vested with the power to execute the laws of the state and to issue executive orders. He supervised the nineteen departments of the executive branch, ran the executive office of the governor, and appointed members to state boards and commissions. The governor submitted messages to the state legislature and recommended measures considered necessary or desirable; in short, Blanchard set a legislative agenda. A key element of this agenda were the annual state budgets submitted to the legislature, recommending revenues to meet proposed expenditures. Although Blanchard had the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, he exercised this power with care. Blanchard also was empowered to seek extraditions and issue warrants on fugitives from justice. Finally, as governor, Blanchard was the commander-in-chief of the state's armed forces. In addition to these roles defined by law, custom, and practice, Blanchard used the governorship as a platform from which to champion Michigan.

 In the course of completing the many tasks inhering in the office of governor, Blanchard and his executive office created and reviewed a welter of written documents. These records and papers provide an important source documenting the executive actions for the years of Blanchard's tenure, 1983-1990. Many are in the departmental files at the State Archives. This collection of papers at the Bentley Library constitutes that portion of executive documentation which Blanchard, upon leaving office, decreed personal in accordance with the traditional practice of recent governors of Michigan.

 The materials came from geographically distinct offices (Lansing, Detroit, Upper Peninsula, and Washington), reflected the efforts of staff ranging from policy analysts to Blanchard himself, and were preserved in varying degrees of completeness. Among these records and papers retained are: correspondence, budgets, memoranda, reports, briefing books, minutes and agenda, press releases and public statements, legal briefs and decisions, legislative bills and analyses, clippings, photographs, audiotapes, and videotapes. These materials were especially strong in documenting the Blanchard administration's investment in human capital and education, efforts to promote economic development and create jobs, interest in rebuilding Michigan's infrastructure while preserving and restoring its environmental beauty, and generally reflecting its commitment to act to promote the commonweal. The collection sheds some light on affirmative action, citizens' protection, criminal justice, the Michigan Youth Corps, and attitudes of Michigan residents as reflected in letters to the governor. The collection is weak in its coverage of Blanchard's private life and his activities related to the Democratic party.

 Researchers should note that Blanchard's executive office was not a rule-bound operation, restricted by strict adherence to hierarchical functions. There was considerable sharing of responsibilities, especially at the higher levels of the administration. One finds that roles filled by a chief of staff sometimes devolved to an executive assistant or to a staff member in the Legal or Government Relations Office. Work on large recurring projects, like the budget or the state of the state address, involved participation at many levels cutting across offices. Day to day functions, like responding to issue-oriented constituent correspondence, often entailed action by the chief of staff, counsel, or a policy analyst from the Washington Office, in addition to the expected responses from the Issues and Correspondence Offices. These sorts of overlap are noted when appropriate in the finding aid.

 The Chief of Staff had the primary responsibility for seeing to the efficient functioning of the executive office of the Governor. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Chief of Staff interacted with nearly every department in the executive branch of state government and with each unit within the executive office. The Chief of Staff served as a sort of gatekeeper for the Governor, apprising him of significant issues, informing him of how best to respond, and judging how effectively the response meets the issue. During Blanchard's two terms in office, he was served by four Chiefs of Staff: F. Thomas Lewand, Phillip Jourdan, Rick Cole, and Steve Weiss. Records are extant from each chief except Rick Cole; these range from the thin but rich records of Lewand to the more fulsome materials of Jourdan and Weiss.

 The efforts of the Chief of Staff to facilitate frictionless functioning of state governance were augmented by able deputies, competent staff, and a cadre of Executive Assistants. Chief among these assistants were Nancy Austin-Schwartz, Bill Liebold, Carolyn Sparks, and Ron Thayer. Given that the Blanchard administration was democratic and decidedly non-hierarchical, these Executive Assistants often filled roles similar to the Chiefs of Staff. At these highest levels of administration, decisions were made and actions taken without much regard to hierarchy or job description strictures. In this free market of ideas and ability, whoever had the best idea or was best able to handle a situation attended to it. Sometimes this was the chief, sometimes one of the assistants, but just as often things were handled by other members of the executive office staff or by someone from an executive department.

 The Correspondence Office was that division within the Executive Office which received, routed, and responded to constituent correspondence. In handling this task, staff in the Correspondence Office worked closely with the Issues Development Office, with head of executive branch departments, and with the Office Operations Division. Mail received by the unit was directed to specialists in Issues Development, to the appropriate state department, to the Governor's personal attention, or handled with a standard response. Given the volume of mail directed to the Governor's attention (at times reaching thousands of pieces per week) and its issues-oriented nature, one should not be surprised to find that most mail sparked a standard response. The bulk of the materials saved reflects the office's efforts to individually address constituent concerns in a timely fashion. This work originally was the domain of an autonomous Communications Unit, fell to the correspondence unit within the Operations Division for a time, until finally it was established as a separate office. Donna Kaufman oversaw this unit from 1983 until 1988 when Patrick Casey took charge.

 The Government Relations Office was the unit which tracked the Governor's legislative agenda and the executive branch's reaction to bills coming out of the legislature. The Government Relations Office served as the Governor's interface with the Michigan House and Senate. In fulfilling this mission, the office had to rely upon the advice and consent of many within the executive office, specifically the Legal Division and the Issues Office (especially the intergovernmental relations unit). This reliance on diverse input was evident in Blanchard's first term as the Legal/ Legislative/Government Relations functions were all met by a single office, headed by Conrad Mallet, Jr. There exists little to document Mallet's tenure as head of this office, aside from transition files and enrolled house and senate bills. During Blanchard's second term the legislative functions fell to separate government relations, legal, and issues offices which then maintained a close working relationship. Stan Fedewa, and later, William Kandler, directed the work of the Government Relations Office at this time. The efforts of both of these men are well reflected in the extant materials.

 The Issues Development Office was charged with delineating, articulating and disseminating the official Blanchard position on the topics of the day. These functions, central to the administration, insured that the issues office would be integral to the executive office. This is manifest in the myriad array of units heavily reliant on the Issues Development Office for their own operations; the Chief of Staff, Executive Assistants, Correspondence, Government Relations, Legal, and Press Offices all were in daily contact with Issues. Within the Issues Development Office, responsibilities were divided among analysts according to issue: agriculture, education, environment, human services, local government, and urban affairs. These analysts reported to the office manager, who in turn reported to the Deputy Chief of Staff, who checked that positions were consistent with the policy goals of the administration.

 The Issues Development Office eventually came to house the papers of the Local Government Advisor. Connie Shorter was the senior staff member responsible for local government affairs and she moved with the unit from its original home in the Policy Department, through the Government Relations Office, back to Issues. The office also served as aegis for special projects ranging from the Cabinet Council on Human Investment, to Citizens' Protection, to the Public Investment Task Force. The issues office itself underwent numerous name changes over the years, beginning as the Policy Office, then to Planning and Program Development, before settling on Issues Development in 1987. In whatever guise, under whatever name, this office remained poised to build Blanchard's stance on any issue.

 The Legal Division dealt with the many legal problems arising out of running a state government. These include, but are not limited to, issues related to administrative rules, bonds, local charters, corrections, crime, pardons, extraditions, legislation, and protection of civil rights. This rather broad array of issues eventually proved too disparate to be capably handled by the relatively small legal staff, so some duties were shunted to the Government Relations and Issues Offices. As with the government relations materials above, there are no materials from Conrad Mallet, Jr.'s tenure. Materials relating to administrative and emergency rules, bonds, local charters, pardons, and extraditions have not been retained with this collection; they are retained by the State Archives. What has been retained from the Legal Division are the papers of Mike Hodge, Legal Advisor and Special Counsel to the Governor from 1987 to 1990. Hodge's papers superbly document the legal concerns facing Blanchard during his second term.

 The Operations Division's primary function within the Blanchard administration was scheduling the Governor's out-of-office events. This entailed handling the thousands of invitations for the Governor to appear, deciding which of these events merited Blanchard's presence, making local arrangements with the advance team, briefing Blanchard on the hot-button issues, and serving as liaison between local contacts and the executive office. Jill Pennington capably directed the scheduling unit for both of Blanchard's terms as governor. During one of the periodic reorganizations of the executive office, the Operations Division oversaw the correspondence unit and a speakers bureau. Both of these proved to be outside the scope of the scheduling mission and were dealt out of operations' hand in the next office restructuring. The division remained committed to placing a prepared Blanchard before congenial forums.

 The Personnel Division was charged with filling all appointive positions in the executive and judicial branches of state government. These positions include all executive posts on boards, commissions, task forces and the executive office, as well as all court posts ranging from courts of appeals, to district courts, to the State Supreme Court. The Personnel Division was initially headed up by Ron Thayer. Shelby Solomon next ran the office. The papers related to personnel division during the tenure of both of these men was not forwarded with the Blanchard collection. All that remains are the papers of Gregory Morris, director of the division from 1987 to 1990. The materials Morris retained dealt exclusively with Blanchard's judicial appointments from 1983 to 1990. This narrow, but very important, stratum of information remains the only evidence on how and who Blanchard chose to extend his program.

 The Press Office presented the public face for the Blanchard administration. This office coordinated press conferences, released policy statements and copies of Blanchard's speeches, arranged photo opportunities, mediated with local and state media, and generally put the best possible spin on the administration. The Press Office was the single point of fixity in the field of flux that was the Blanchard executive office. This office fell under the eye of only two directors, Rick Cole and Tom Scott, during the two gubernatorial terms. Scott was with the office almost from the outset and is largely responsible for the retention of much of the materials. He treated the Press Office as the archives of the executive office, saving newspaper clippings, press releases, speeches, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs which document the public life of Blanchard. These materials provide the most comprehensive picture of Blanchard as politician, statesman, governor.

 The Upper Peninsula Office was one of the regional offices established by the executive office to better serve a specific clientele, in this case the residents of the upper peninsula. This office brought the services of state government to the more immediate attention of upper peninsula citizens. It answered constituent correspondence, served as liaison between county officials and the state, and briefed the Governor for his trips to the upper peninsula. In short the Upper Peninsula Office provided a scaled-down version of the outreach functions offered by the executive office. Tom Baldini, director of the office, filled his post so competently that he was viewed by the executive office and citizens as the ""governor"" of the upper peninsula.

 The Washington Office served as a clearinghouse for information on federal proposals, congressional legislation, and national policy developments. It also lobbied for the interests of the state. In pursuing these ambitious, if amorphous, interests, the Washington Office employed a staff of five to ten people over the years of Blanchard's tenure. The staff of the office worked with Blanchard, the executive office, and Michigan agency directors to develop responses to federal activity, to initiate timely communication between federal and state officials, and to arrange and conduct meetings and conferences when appropriate. Aside from the director of the Washington Office, E. Douglas Frost, who focused on budgets, taxes, and overall policy planning, each of the staff members in the office was responsible for broadly defined issues. Rosemary Freeman, who preceded Frost as office director, served as deputy director and handled issues related to training, labor, and education. James Callow was the legislative analyst charged with keeping abreast of economic and trade issues. Maura Cullen was responsible for social services, health and human services, and child welfare. Peter Kyriacopolous was the last of three analysts (Charlie Moses and Jo Ellen D'Arcy preceded him) who handled concerns related to the environment and transportation.","James J. Blanchard, the first Democratic governor of Michigan in twenty years, won the 1982 gubernatorial election over Richard Headlee with a plurality of less than 200,000 out of three million votes cast. When Blanchard took office, the state faced its gravest economic challenges since the depression: slumping auto sales pushed unemployment over 17%, while diminishing the state's tax base; a $1.7 billion deficit loomed and finances were further straitened when the state's credit rating was downgraded; outmigration of educated and skilled workers threatened the human capital of Michigan. Working with his cabinet, public and private sector leaders, and members of the legislature, Blanchard righted Michigan's finances, upgraded the state's credit rating, and launched an aggressive economic development program to diversify Michigan's economy and provide jobs for its citizens.

 Among the recovery programs set in motion by Blanchard were: the establishment of the Michigan Youth Corps, a program which created 40,000 jobs for young people; installing a public works project which provided 50,000 jobs dedicated to improving the state's infrastructure; the formation of the Governor's Commission on Jobs and Economic Development, a coalition of business, labor, education, and government leaders; adoption of a zero-growth state budget and an unpopular temporary income tax increase; and development of an aggressive plan to protect the environment, especially the Great Lakes. By 1985, the state had turned the corner on the worst of its economic problems, achieving solvency by November and consequently having Michigan's credit upgraded to the best among American states. The Blanchard administration credited its own efforts for spurring this economic recovery.

 Blanchard campaigned in 1986 on the theme, ""Michigan, the Comeback State."" He easily defeated challenger, William Lucas, winning over 68% over the votes cast. Backed by this mandate, Blanchard embarked on a more ambitious agenda of reform. This broader program included, but was by no means limited to: strengthening the state's finances, innovation and integrity in public policy, improving education, preserving the right of choice for women, protecting children and families, and being tough on criminals. The Michigan Strategic Fund is an apt example of innovative policy designed to provide capital for small businesses and to diversify the state economy. Education was a top priority for Blanchard, and his second term saw the development of a broad array of education initiatives: the Michigan Education Trust, a state-supported guaranteed tuition program; the Research Excellence Fund, state-financed research in new technologies; the Michigan Model Health Curriculum, an ambitious effort to educate all students on good health habits; and the Michigan Opportunity Card, a surety of competence offered by the Cabinet Council on Human Investment. Michigan hosted several conferences on environmental issues as it attended to preventive and palliative measures to preserve the region's ecology. Blanchard created the post of Citizens' Protection Advisor to secure Michiganders' rights. All these efforts reveal the activist bent of the Blanchard administration.

 Blanchard came to the office of governor at a propitious moment, a time when states were taking up responsibilities shunted by the federal government. Reagan's New Federalism accelerated the shifting of powers and duties to state and local agencies, a trend initiated by Nixon's revenue sharing. Blanchard brought an apt philosophy to this situation. Blanchard described himself as, ""of the new breed of governors: innovative, flexible, global in outlook and unafraid to challenge the status quo."" These attributes served him well in meeting the needs of the Michigan citizenry and economy. His administration was pragmatic, fiscally conservative, and acted within the parameters of the possible. Blanchard shunned adherence to ideology, save the ideal that governments can, and should, act to benefit people. These traits were apparent in his administrative legacy.

 Immediately before winning his first gubernatorial term in the 1982 election, Blanchard served in the United States Congress for four terms representing several Detroit suburbs. While in Congress, he won acclaim for his work in shaping the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Act, an act which saved thousands of Michigan jobs. Blanchard's service to the people of Michigan began in 1968 as legal advisor to the Michigan Secretary of State. In 1969, he became an Assistant Attorney General and served in that capacity for five years before being elected to Congress.

 James Blanchard was born in Detroit on August 8, 1942. He earned a B.A. and M.B.A. from Michigan State University and a law degree from the University of Minnesota. Blanchard married Paula Parker in June 1966; they had one son, Jay, in 1971. The Blanchards were divorced in 1987. James Blanchard married Janet Fox in the fall of 1989. After failing to win a third term as governor, Blanchard repaired to a private legal practice. He served as ambassador to Canada in the Clinton administration and ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor in 2002.",5987; 3873; 3874; 3875; 3849; 5987,Governors; Governors; Parades; Political elections; Politics and government; Governors,lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh,3141; 3142; 3144; 3221,Videotapes.; Photographs.; Sound recordings.; Digital audio files.,aat; aat; aat; aat,804; 804,Michigan; Michigan,local; local,322; 322; 322; 322,"Blanchard, James J., 1942-; Blanchard, James J., 1942-; Blanchard, James J., 1942-; Blanchard, James J., 1942-",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,3775; 4457; 4457; 3775; 4457,Democratic Party (Mich.); Michigan.

He graduated from the University of Michigan Law Department in 1899, was admitted to the bar, and then began practice in Lapeer at that time. After short stints as a newspaper publisher and secretary to the Michigan Railroad Commission, Cramton embarked on a career of public political service that was both diverse and enduring. He served as a member of the State House of Representatives in 1909 and 1910; was a Republican member of Congress from 1913 to 1931; special attorney to the Secretary of the Interior in 1931 and 1932; circuit judge of Michigan's fortieth circuit court from 1934 through 1941; was elected to the State house of representatives again in 1948 and served until his retirement at the end of 1960. Throughout his public career, Cramton distinguished himself as able legislator, jurist, and lawyer. He was a staunch advocate of the maintenance of the National Park system and of historic preservation of landmarks and buildings. He also championed increased opportunity for the disadvantaged; witness Cramton's legislative efforts to improve the health, education, and industrial development of American Indians, his patronage of Howard University, and his work on the fair employment-practices law in Michigan.

Between 1954 and 1955 Dingell served as an assistant prosecutor in Wayne County. In 1952, John Dingell Jr. married Helen Patricia Henebry, a flight attendant, and together they have four children: Christopher, Jeanne, John David (III), and Jennifer. The couple divorced in 1972.

John Dingell, Jr. began his congressional service in 1938, at age 12, as a page in the U.S. House, a position he held until 1943. In 1955, John Dingell, Sr. died and John Dingell, Jr., at age 29, won a special election to fill his father’s congressional seat, marking the beginning of Dingell’s 59-year career in Congress.

During his tenure in Congress, John Dingell served on many committees and was involved in important legislative achievements of the 20th century. Dingell, a Democrat, voted in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and presided over the successful passage of Medicare in 1965. Following the example set by his father, in 1956 Dingell introduced a bill to provide national health insurance to all Americans, a practice he would continue every term until the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In 1957, after winning his first full term in Congress, Dingell was appointed to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (later renamed Energy and Commerce). He was heavily involved in environmental legislation including a 1961 law to protect wetlands, the Water Pollution Control Act, and the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, which he authored. In 1973, Dingell sponsored the Endangered Species Act and throughout the 1970s continued to champion legislation to protect wildlife and the environment. Dingell ascended to Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce in 1981, a position he held nonconsecutively, due to party changes in the House, until 2009. 

In 1979, Dingell met Deborah (Debbie) Ann Insley, a recent graduate of Georgetown University and a lobbyist for General Motors. Insley, born November 23, 1953, grew up in Michigan and was a descendant of the Fisher family, founders of Fisher Body Company, a division of General Motors. They were wed in 1981. Debbie Dingell was actively involved in her husband's political career and continued to hold top positions at the General Motors Foundation, other charities, and in 2015 succeeded her husband as Congresswoman for Michigan's 12th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

John Dingell was an active sportsman and hunter serving on the board of the National Rifle Association (NRA) for many years. He was also a member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for over 40 years and a strong advocate of the establishment of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, created by Congress in 2001. 

In 1995, upon the retirement of Rep. Jamie Whitten, Dingell became Dean of the House. On June 7, 2013 John Dingell, Jr. became the longest-serving member in Congressional history, surpassing the tenure of Senator Robert C. Byrd. He retired January 3, 2015 and resided in Michigan. Dingell remained active on social media, primarily Twitter, and was an outspoken critic of the 45th President of the United States, and an avid fan of University of Michigan and Detroit-based sports.

843,umich-bhl-0434,"John Engler Papers, 1968-2003","Republican member of the Michigan state legislature (House and Senate, 1971-1990); governor of Michigan (1991-2003); active member of the Republican Governors' Association and the National Governors' Association. The Engler collection consists primarily of materials created and maintained by Governor Engler and his staff during the period when he was governor, 1991-2003. Other records include papers from his several terms in the Michigan House and the Michigan Senate. The collection includes papers files, photographs, sound recordings, videotapes, memorabilia, and some electronic files. The gubernatorial files are arranged mainly by unit or functional responsibility within the governor's office. These series are Executive Office, Communications Division, Legal Division, State Government Affairs, Legislative Affairs Division, Operations Division, External Affairs, Scheduling, Washington DC Office, and Office of the First Lady. Topics extensively documented include state welfare and school funding reform, reorganization of state boards and commissions, notably the restructuring of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and Republican party politics.",The finding aid is written in English,"The John Engler papers are the most important source available for the study of Michigan's state government from 1991 to 2002. The collection is particularly strong on the topics of welfare and school funding reform, state government reorganization and the rising impact of the National Governors' Association in state and national politics. Engler's efforts to attract commerce to Michigan are also well-documented. The materials are arranged into two main subgroups: Pre-gubernatorial Papers and Gubernatorial Papers. The bulk of the material relates to Engler's gubernatorial career, therefore, the analysis that follows focuses primarily on this subgroup.

 The materials in the ""Gubernatorial Papers"" subgroup are arranged according to the offices and subdivisions of the governor's office that created them. This means that the governor's speeches and press releases, for example, may be found within a grouping or ""series"" called ""Communications Division,"" within the ""Gubernatorial"" subgroup, while legislative histories for various public acts may be found within the ""Legislative Affairs"" series.

 While some kinds of documents were produced uniquely by one division, other kinds were produced in several divisions of the governor's office. The governor's correspondence, for example, was drafted and approved by several different staff members. Letters to important business and political leaders may be found within the ""Executive Office"" series, the ""State Government Affairs"" series, and the ""Washington DC Office"" series in particular. There no comprehensive chronological correspondence file.

 In using the collection, the researcher should think functionally and ask who would have created the information sought. For example, the policy advisors in the State Government Affairs Division created individual topical files which gathered together correspondence and research materials to support briefing memoranda which they presented to the governor, while the speechwriters in the Communications Division often gathered different types of materials to help them shape the presentation of the same policies to the public.","When John Engler became Michigan's governor in 1991, he brought with him a classically conservative vision of a smaller, more efficient government, and of a state where taxes were lower, individual initiative was rewarded and business and opportunity could thrive. As Michigan's governor during the boom years of the 1990's, Engler led the state during a period of uncommon prosperity between 1991 and 2002. At the beginning of his tenure, however, Michigan's economy was less than ideal.

 After defeating incumbent James Blanchard in 1990 in an upset election, Engler inherited a $1.8 billion deficit. He embarked on an effort to cut spending and taxes, and reorganized the government. His first term spending cuts were painful and controversial, and included cuts in welfare for childless adults, state mental-health facilities, and arts programs. In the aftermath, Engler was widely viewed as a cold-hearted bureaucrat who was more concerned with balancing budgets than with the pain and suffering of poor people. But as it turned out, Michigan was on the vanguard of a national movement to change welfare, putting more focus on work. By the time Engler sought re-election in 1994, none of the three Democrats seeking the nomination proposed a return to the General Assistance Program.

 In his effort to achieve greater efficiency in state government, Engler presided over the most dramatic restructuring of state government in a generation. He eliminated entire departments and abolished dozens of boards and commissions. He pushed the power of the Executive Branch to the fullest extent permitted by the Michigan Constitution to implement his reorganizations.

 In 1995 Engler split the Michigan Department of Natural Resources into a parks and recreation-oriented DNR, and a new Department of Environmental Quality, charged with monitoring pollution and public health. The changes were controversial because critics claimed they interfered with citizen oversight.

 He also created the Michigan Jobs Commission and later, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. With an aggressive business attraction strategy and a locally driven job training system, Michigan managed to attract many new job-creating businesses. In fact, Michigan earned the prestigious ""Governor's Cup"" -- representing the nation's number one state for new factories and expansion projects -- a record-setting four years in a row (1997-2000).

 But education reform was Engler's top priority. He led the campaign to win citizen approval for Proposal A -- a 1994 ballot initiative that radically changed the way Michigan's public schools are funded. By loosening the connection between local property taxes and school funding, he aimed to make per-student funding more fair. And even though Proposal A slashed homeowners local property school tax rates by an average of 45%, school spending grew during Engler's tenure, from about $8 billion annually to nearly $12 billion--benefiting from booming tax revenues during the bountiful 1990's.

 Engler also championed school choice, charter schools and more competition as part of his plan to help Michigan schools improve. His administration focused on high standards, more accountability, tough tests, improved safety and more discipline to help Michigan's students learn better.

 Engler also saw the power of technology to create jobs and better people's lives. As the first governor to have a website, he pushed for increased availability of high-speed broadband Internet, and supported the creation of the nation's first on-line cybercourts. He also introduced a program to distribute laptop computers to more than 88,000 K-12 teachers statewide.

 Engler was Chairman of the Republican Governors' Association in 1996 and of the National Governor's Association July 2001 to July 2002. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the Republican National Leadership Council and was considered a top-seeded candidate for Bob Dole's Vice Presidential running-mate in 1996.

 John Engler was born October 12, 1948, the oldest of Mathias and Agnes Engler's seven children. His parents raised cattle on 900 acres near Beal City, Michigan and John majored in agricultural economics at Michigan State University. As a class project for a political science class, Engler wrote a paper outlining his strategy for winning a Republican primary against an incumbent for a seat in the state legislature. In 1970, before graduating, he enlisted the help of his friend, sophomore Dick Posthumus, and put his plan into action. He won the primary, and the general election to become, at age 22, the youngest Michigan legislator. Indeed, in his thirty-year political career, John Engler never lost an election.

 The Republicans were the minority party in the Michigan House when Engler set out in 1971, although Republican William Milliken controlled the governor's office. Engler served eight years in the House and twelve years in the Michigan Senate, rising to become Senate Majority Leader in 1984 after leading an intense effort to tip the balance toward the GOP. While serving in the legislature, Engler attended law school part-time and received his degree from Thomas Cooley Law School in 1981.

 He married fellow lawmaker Colleen House in 1975, though they divorced in 1986. He wed again to attorney Michelle DeMunbrun in 1990. They are the parents of triplet daughters, Margaret, Hannah and Madeleine, born November 13, 1994, just days after his reelection to a second gubernatorial term.",6248; 7488; 6688; 7489; 5987; 7490; 3873; 3875; 3849,Conservation of natural resources; Educational change; Environmental protection; Family policy; Governors; Public welfare administration; Governors; Political elections; Politics and government,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3191; 3142; 3144; 3141,Digital file formats.; Photographs.; Sound recordings.; Videotapes.,aat; aat; aat; aat,911; 818; 819; 1774; 1774,Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan,lcsh; local; local; lcsh; lcsh,4448; 4448; 4448; 4448; 3291,"Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, John, 1948-; Engler, Michelle.",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,11; 4319; 725; 4636; 4077; 4077; 11; 4077,Michigan.

Not only are public issues discussed in the correspondence files but the researcher will also gain an understanding of some of the personal problems associated with public service. The collection also includes several files of other family members.,"Alpheus Felch was born in Limmerick, York County, Maine, on September 23, 1804. He died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on June 13, 1896. Felch's career as a lawyer and politician crisscrossed the United States, although the majority of his life was devoted to service in his adopted state of Michigan.

 Orphaned at the age of three, Alpheus Felch was raised by his paternal grandfather, and later a family friend, Edmund Hayes. In 1821 Felch entered Phillips Exeter Academy, at Exeter, New Hampshire. Financial problems led Felch to become a school teacher and to finish his initial schooling at the academy in Fryeburg, Maine. In 1823 Alpheus Felch was admitted to the freshman class at Bowdoin College, where he continued to supplement his income with teaching assignments. He graduated from Bowdoin in 1827.

 In pursuit of a legal career, Felch entered the offices of Bradley and Barrow in Fryeburg and later continued his training in Bangor, Maine. Alpheus Felch was admitted to the bar in 1830, and almost immediately was commissioned to recover a law library in Houlton, Maine. He remained there in the practice of law until 1833, when he undertook a journey to the South for reasons of health. A combination of factors, including the contraction of Cholera, led Felch to Monroe, Michigan. He settled in Monroe until 1843, when Ann Arbor became his permanent residence.

 Alpheus Felch's first political position was that of Monroe County representative in the State legislature, 1835-1837. He then served as State Bank Commissioner in 1838 and 1839, and is credited with exposing much of the corruption associated with ""wild cat"" banking. In 1842 Felch was made Auditor General of the state, but was appointed to the State Supreme Court only a few weeks later, upon the resignation of Judge William A. Fletcher. Felch served in this position until 1845, when he was elected governor.

 Alpheus Felch served as governor of Michigan from January 5, 1846, to March 3, 1847, when he resigned this office upon his election to the United States Senate. Felch served in the Senate from March 4, 1847, to March 3, 1853. He was an active member on the Committee on Public Lands, and during his final four years in office was its chairman.

 In 1853 Felch was appointed president of the commission to settle land claims in California. This commission acted upon Spanish, Mexican, and American claims to lands in California from 1853 to 1856. In June of 1856, with the commission's work complete, Felch returned to Ann Arbor and the practice of law. In the spring of 1879 he was appointed Tappan law professor at the University of Michigan, a position from which Felch resigned in 1883. Alpheus Felch remained an active figure in his later years, serving as president of the Michigan State Historical Society from 1888 to 1894.

 Alpheus Felch married Lucretia Williams Lawrence of Monroe, Michigan, on September 14, 1837. They had eight children, five sons and three daughters. Mrs. Felch died on July 30, 1882.",7800; 6386; 6806; 7801; 7802; 7803; 7804; 7805; 5987; 4265; 4266; 6806,"Banks and banking; Elections; Indians of North America.; Land use; Mines and mineral resources; Presidents; Presidents; Mexican War, 1846-1848.; Governors; Death.; Dwellings; Indians of North America.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh,3142; 3472,Photographs.; Prints.,aat; gmgpc,861; 1284; 1850; 894; 1144; 1674; 939; 830; 826; 828; 806; 807; 797; 798; 1726; 1167; 937; 910; 1851; 290; 910,Ann Arbor (Mich.); California.; Canada; Flint (Mich.); Lapeer (Mich.); Maine.; Upper Peninsula (Mich.); Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Minnesota.; Monroe (Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie (Mich.); United States; United States; Monroe (Mich.); United States,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; local; local; local; local; local; local; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh,675; 5474; 8963; 1261; 675; 1018; 1132; 675; 4275; 1242; 870; 3789; 2088; 37; 5545; 3415; 2789; 572; 3587; 1513; 4985; 7024; 2720; 1483; 4139; 8149; 4616; 1123; 8972; 8213; 6849; 2822; 7436; 2721; 1676; 6192; 2463; 4262; 5518; 3750; 2268; 6028; 1761; 3324; 1471; 4672; 3763; 8716; 3209; 6671; 7189; 6155; 6920; 4895; 3254; 9106; 3411; 8081; 2806; 49; 5207; 9029; 2083; 4683; 6224; 2029; 8943; 6444; 1322; 7938; 1620; 8151; 7569; 6667; 1625; 7852; 8848; 3316; 661; 4161; 2682; 6057; 6631; 8857; 3011; 825; 5902; 4498; 5289; 9055; 3220; 8454; 5046; 3654; 6874; 284; 4426; 4323; 3671; 113; 7526; 5851; 5245; 7961; 336; 8657; 3714; 8672; 2180; 7908; 5247; 671; 1813; 2544; 337; 5097; 2731; 2959; 6946; 4638; 3471; 2020; 823; 7717; 2980; 5745; 8770; 9098; 6775; 1431; 168; 4189; 2535; 7740; 5849; 1392; 1800; 8885,"Felch, Alpheus, 1804-1896; Barry, John Stewart, 1802-1870; Bingham, Kinsley S.

The collection consists of twelve series and is primarily arranged according to office of origin. The series are: Transition 2002, Legal Division, Policy Division, Executive Office, Communications Division, Economic Recovery Office, Northern Michigan Office, Other Executive Divisions, Office of the Lieutenant Governor, Office of the First Gentleman, Archived Websites, and Memorabilia. While the collection documents the full range of Governor Granholm's activities, it is especially strong in documenting the governor's efforts in the areas of economic diversification, renewable energy, education, and Michigan's response to the 2008 financial crisis. Also of note are the documents pertaining to the Governor's Hearing on the Removal of Kwame Kilpatrick from the office of Mayor of Detroit, the Legal Division files on the state's interactions with Michigan's Native American tribes, the administration's work on behalf of the University of Michigan in the Gratz and Grutter affirmative action lawsuits, the administration's response to Proposal 2, and dossiers kept on each Michigan soldier killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan.","Jennifer Granholm was born February 5, 1959 in Vancouver, British Columbia to Shirley Alfreda Dowden and Victor Ivar Granholm. At the age of four, Granholm's family moved to California; she grew up in Anaheim, San Jose, and San Carlos. Granholm earned a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1984 and continued her education at Harvard Law School. After receiving her J.D. in 1987, Granholm moved to Michigan where she began her career as a law clerk for Judge Damon Keith of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1990 she became a U. S. Prosecutor in Detroit, and served as corporation counsel for Wayne County from 1994 to 1996 before becoming the general counsel for the Detroit and Wayne County Stadium Authority.

 Granholm entered statewide politics in 1998 when she ran for Attorney General on the Democratic ticket. She was the only Democrat elected to statewide office that year and served in the position through 2002. Towards the end of her term she had gained enough statewide recognition to enter the governor's race. Announcing her candidacy in March of 2001, she defeated both former governor James Blanchard and House Democratic Whip David Bonior to win the Democratic primary. In November of 2002, she won the general election, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Dick Posthumus to become Michigan's first female governor.

 Granholm took office as Michigan's 47th governor on January 1, 2003. The beginning of her tenure as governor coincided with a difficult period in Michigan's economic history. As the rest of the country recovered from the 2001 recession, Michigan continued to struggle. In her first year as governor, Granholm faced a $3 billion budget deficit and a rising unemployment rate. Her administration's response to the challenges it faced reflected Granholm's moderate approach by focusing on reinforcing education, promoting economic diversification, and improving government efficiency through cost cutting and streamlining.

 Despite challenges early in her first term, Granholm set about an extensive program of cuts to state expenditures in order to balance Michigan's budget. She continued to seek cost saving measures throughout her first term. Granholm also focused on education and, in 2004, established the Cherry Commission, headed by Lieutenant Governor John Cherry, to study ways to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. She also implemented rigorous K-8 standards through the State Board of Education, increased high school graduation requirements, and created the Early Childhood Investment Corporation.

 After two years in office, as Michigan's economy began to stall, Granholm pursued a multi-pronged effort to spur job creation and increase the state's flagging tax base. In 2005, Granholm kicked off her economic revitalization program with the 21st Century Jobs Fund, a $2 billion program that used tobacco settlement funds to encourage diversification in the state's economy. Granholm also launched the <emph render=""italic"">Pure Michigan</emph> advertising campaign to promote tourism and Michigan's leisure industry. The administration viewed Google's choice of Ann Arbor for its AdWords operation as a victory for its diversification efforts. In addition to pursuing economic diversification, Granholm created the Michigan Earned Income Tax Credit and signed bills that increased the minimum wage.

 With the continued downward spiral of Michigan's economy, including the loss of Greenville, Michigan's Electrolux plant to Juarez, Mexico in 2004, Granholm faced a tough re-election bid in 2006. Despite a concerted challenge from Republican Dick DeVos, a concerted campaign effort from early September through Election Day led to Granholm's eventual re-election.

 Granholm's second term focused primarily on Michigan's economy. She launched the term with No Worker Left Behind, a program designed to give unemployed and under-employed workers the opportunity to receive training for high-demand jobs. The governor's other efforts at job creation included emphasizing the clean and renewable energy industry and incentives for the production of auto batteries. In April, 2008, Granholm announced a set of film incentives. The incentive package was designed to both create jobs immediately and spur long-term growth. After the financial crisis of 2008, Granholm redoubled her efforts on behalf of Michigan's economy, speaking out on behalf of the state's beleaguered auto industry during the federal bailout and pursuing increased efforts at diversification. In addition to her work on behalf of Michigan's economy, Granholm also signed the Promise Zone legislation in 2008 to give students in high-poverty communities the opportunity to attend college, presided over the hearing regarding the removal of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and reorganized and shut down several state departments in the interest of increased efficiency and budgetary restraint.  

 Governor Granholm's tenure ended on January 1, 2011.   She is currently a Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Law and Public Policy at her alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley. She is also a Senior Research Fellow at the Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute (BECI), a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts' Clean Energy Program, and founder of The American Jobs Project at UC Berkeley. In 2011, she served on the Board of Trustees of the Dow Chemical Corporation. 
 
 
 
 On September 6, 2012 Granholm delivered a passionate speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. In her speech Granholm focused on the automotive industry crisis of 2008--2010 and the beneficial effect of President Obama's decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler on the U.S. economy. At the same time, Granholm underscored the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's opposition to the bailout.
 
 
 
 
 
 Granholm served as a direct ""surrogate"" for Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign. 
 
 
 In December 2020, President Joe Biden nominated Granholm to be the next Secretary of Energy.

1129,umich-bhl-85193,Philip A. Hart Papers,"U. S. Senator from Michigan, 1959-1976, a conscientious supporter of civil rights, consumer protection and environmentalism, Hart served as floor manager of the 1965 civil rights act and 1968 Open Housing Act, introduced legislation to create Sleeping Bear Dunes and Pictured Rock National Lakeshores and sponsored important consumer legislation. Papers include Legislative Files, Staff Files, Press Files, Subject Files, Constituent Correspondence, Office Files, Political Files, Miscellaneous, Sound Recordings, and Visual Materials.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The Philip A. Hart collection consists of those files maintained by Hart and his staff in Washington D.C. while serving as senator from Michigan in the period 1958-1976. A senate office in the 1960s and 1970s could employ as many as thirty staff and clerical workers. In 1975, Hart wrote: ""My own office presently consists of 34 full-time people in Washington plus 4 in my Detroit office and one part-time employee each in Grand Rapids and Marquette."" Received from Washington, the Hart collection documents the workings of his Capitol office. Excepting for a few files from the 1950s when Hart served in Michigan state government, the Hart papers relate exclusively to Senate activities and detail the variety and bulk of problems crossing the desk of a United States senator and his staff.

 In a press release describing his office, Hart stated that the work of a senator falls into three categories: legislative, participating in the discussion and formulation of public policy, and serving as ""ambassador"" between his constituents and the Federal Government. Beyond the study of legislation, public policy debates, and the relationship between a senator and the people of his state, the Hart collection is a reflection of the times in which Hart served, the sixties and seventies, years of the presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford, a time when public figures discussed issues of conscience and of war, matters of human rights and of public morality, areas where Hart's basic integrity and humaneness placed him in the forefront of public debate.

 The collection falls into eleven principal series: Personal/Biographical, Legislative Files, Staff Files, Press Files, Subject Files, Constituent Correspondence, Office Files, Political Files, Miscellaneous, Sound Recordings, and Visual Materials. Except for Personal/Biographical and the series of audio-visual materials, the Hart collection is an office file and represents the activities of one senator and a dozen or so of his key staff members. To use the collection, the researcher after examining the ""Series Description"" (on the following pages) should note that for any topical study, information will usually be found in any number of series within the collection. The series represent functional divisions within the Hart office, legislation, press, or whatever. To study an issue such as consumer protection, therefore, the researcher should be prepared to examine the Hart finding aid under the series that might document that topic from different functional perspectives (Legislative Files, Staff Files, Subject Files, among others). The researcher interested in a narrower, more specific topic should recognize that the following inventory, for the most part, is not a folder-level description and thus specialized kinds of information will be filed first under a more general heading.

 One more note: The Hart papers originally consisted of more than 700 linear feet of files. Hart himself and his staff had discarded certain types of files before donating them to the library, notably case files and constituent mail answered by form. In addition, the library discarded files of low research content - thank yous, invitations, and carbons of Hart correspondence duplicated in the other principal series of the collection. Furthermore, files containing similar types of correspondence from constituents have been sampled (the folders have ""S"" or ""Samp"" on them). Government publications, easily available in a government documents library, and unless heavily annotated, have been discarded. Researchers on any topic within the Hart collection should familiarize themselves with the standard sources on government documents (the indices to the Congressional Record for example). Topics on which Hart played a key legislative role or about which he was keenly interested have not been sampled. These topics include civil rights, the passage of various consumer legislation, the Sleeping Bear Dunes debate, his committee work, and the debate over the war in Vietnam to list a few.","Philip A. Hart was United States Senator from Michigan, serving from 1959 until his death in December of 1976. Born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania on December 10, 1912, Hart graduated from Georgetown University in 1934 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1937. He practiced law in Detroit for four years until the outbreak of war when he enlisted in the United States Army. He served until 1946, and was wounded during the D-Day assault on Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion.

 Following the war, Hart returned to the law and embarked on a career in public service. His law school classmate Governor G. Mennen Williams appointed him to the Michigan Corporation Securities Commission (1949-1951); he served as state director of the Office of Price Stabilization (1951-1952), and as United States district attorney of the Eastern Michigan District (1952-1953). As Williams established himself as governor, he relied increasingly on the demonstrated abilities of Hart, serving as his legal advisor (1953-1954), and as lieutenant governor (1955-1958).

 In 1958 Hart was elected to the United States Senate where he served for eighteen years, winning decisive reelections in 1964 and again in 1970. Poor health decided Hart against running for reelection in 1976. He died December 26, 1976, a few weeks from completing his third full term.

 As Senator, Hart earned the reputation of being an honest, hard-working, and conscientious spokesman for the policies and programs of the Democratic party and for liberal Democratic causes in general. When he first came to the Senate, Hart was appointed to two committees: Agriculture and Forestry, and Judiciary. He remained a member of the Judiciary throughout his three terms in the Senate, serving as chairman of its subcommittees on antitrust and monopoly and refugees and escapees in addition to being a member of various other subcommittees relating to immigration, juvenile delinquency, and patents and copyrights. With less interest in matters of agriculture, Hart in 1963 shifted over to the Commerce Committee, where he came to serve as chairman of its subcommittee on energy, natural resources and environment (name later changed to environment) and vice chairman of its consumer affairs subcommittee. Beyond responsibilities associated with these two committees, Hart was member at various times of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, and the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities among others.

 Although he was a sponsor or key sponsor of many pieces of legislation, Hart himself was proudest of his work as floor manager of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Open Housing-Civil Rights Bill, his championing of the legislation to make Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes and Pictured Rocks national lakeshores, and his sponsorship of consumer-related legislation (e.g. truth-in-packaging, truth-in-lending, and truth-in-spending).",8192; 8193; 8194; 6901; 5869; 8195; 6676; 7257; 8196; 7884; 5970; 5869; 8197; 8198; 8199; 8200,"Antimissile missiles.; Antitrust law.; Automobiles; Civil rights; Conservation of natural resources; Consumer protection.; Elections; Elections; Environmental protection; Legislators; Vietnamese Conflict, 1961-1975.; Conservation of natural resources; Politics and government; Politics and government; Politics and government; Riots.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3468; 3499; 3463; 3142; 3141,Cartoons.; DVD.; Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Videotapes.,gmgpc; gmgpc; gmgpc; aat; aat,811; 812; 803; 1499; 1012; 1278; 934; 1499; 1012,Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (Mich.); Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (Mich.); United States; Detroit (Mich.); Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (Mich.); Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (Mich.),local; local; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,4297; 4297; 3848; 2894; 4648; 8079; 3183; 120; 4297; 437; 50; 1323; 5533; 3227; 1996; 4131; 283; 8365; 1809; 2127; 3983; 7328; 1110; 8191; 3938; 3904,"Hart, Philip A.

The Commission was a result of the 1956 Governor's Study Commission on Indian Problems and worked within the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services on policies to improve the health, housing, education and economic status of Native Americans in Michigan. Hillman also worked with the North American Indian Association. Reports, policy proposals, directories, newsletters, memoranda from the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs, as well as Hillman's personal correspondence and other papers.",The finding aid is written in English,"The James R. Hillman papers contain materials related to the work of the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs. It also contains additional materials related to Hillman, including his work with the North American Indian Association and his personal writings as a history student at Wayne State University. The materials illustrate the workings of the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs, the issues faced by Native Americans in Michigan during this period, and Hillman’s personal leadership and work on these concerns. 


The collection has been divided into two series: 

The Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs series contains records related to the work of the Commission between 1970-1981. Materials include directories of Native American organizations and individuals, reports, office files, meeting information and other internal documents. This series also contains Hillman's theoretical proposal for the creation of an independent organization to distribute funds that would be run entirely by Native Americans.

The James R. Hillman materials series contains the personal papers of Hillman and documents activities related to his work with the Detroit chapter of the North American Indian Association. The series includes papers written by Hillman as a history student at Wayne State University and materials he compiled for reference, as well as his personal correspondence and clippings. Materials related to the North American Indian Association include office files, study reports and other reference documents. 
","James R. Hillman was born in October 1944, a member of the Wisconsin Onedia Tribe through his great-grandfather, Jake Smith. He was raised in Stevens Point, Wisconsin and graduated from the Wisconsin State University at Stevens Point in 1969. Hillman was influenced by a sense of Native American pride and a desire to combat the lack of tribal identity he sensed in many urban Native Americans. He gained extensive experience in Native American outreach and educational services at the Minnesota Employment Service, Intertribal Councils of Michigan, federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and as Assistant Indian Education Coordinator at the Michigan Department of Education.

In 1973, Hillman was appointed Executive Director of the Michigan Commission for Indian Affairs (MCIA). MCIA originated from the Governor’s Study Commission on Indian Problems created by Governor G. Mennen Williams in 1956. The Governor’s Commission was charged to investigate the status and needs of Native Americans living in Michigan but failed to produce immediate tangible results. However, it did raise an awareness about the problems faced by Native Americans and the need for state action. In 1965, the state legislature established the MCIA as an autonomous body within the Department of Social Services. The Commission consisted of nine commissioners appointed by the governor George W. Romney and the commission staff was overseen by an appointed executive director. 

The Commission advocated for Native Americans from federally recognized tribes and Michigan Historical Tribes and those living both on and off reservations. The Commission also worked closely with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and other private and non-profit organizations. The four main objectives of the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs focused on policies to improve health, education, housing and economic development. These objectives were implemented committees on a variety of topics including legislation, scholarships, arts and crafts, health and wellness and job training.  

As Executive Director of the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs, Hillman coordinated the actions of the commission and worked to build ties between Native American communities, the legislature and Michigan state agencies. Under Hillman, the Commission established a legal services corporation for Michigan Native Americans, developed a Native American community health program and founded 10 additional Indian Centers to help deliver federal assistance programs. The commission also instituted several jobs programs using federal, state and private funding. 

In 1974, Hillman drafted a proposal entitled “A Trust for Indians” which proposed the creation of tax-exempt organization to administer funds to other Native American organizations.  The proposed organization would be run by Native Americans and while it would work with the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs, it would operate independently. While Hillman had drafted this position paper, it was intended as a theoretical exercise and Hillman did not support implementing this program. He believed creating an independent organization might compromise the funding for other programs including the Michigan Indian Legal Services program. 

Following the end of his term as Executive Director in 1977, Hillman worked with the North American Indian Association chapter located in Detroit. The Detroit chapter of the North American Indian Association was established in the 1940s and provided cultural, social and economic resources for the local Native American community. During this time, Hillman also pursued a graduate degree in history at Wayne State University. Hillman authored several books about the history of the Governor’s Study Commission on Indian Affairs and the Michigan Commission on Indian Affairs.

His brother is Sander Levin, U.S. Representative for Michigan's  9th district. Carl Levin attended Detroit public schools, graduating from Central High School in 1952. He worked briefly as a line worker at a Ford tractor factory when he was 19 years old and went on to attend Swarthmore College. As a student, Levin was actively involved in student groups including serving on the student council, the American Student Government Movement, and Students for Democratic Action (SDA). In 1956, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and went on to attend Harvard Law School. Levin continued his student activism with SDA at Harvard and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1959. Upon graduation, Levin returned to Michigan and worked as an attorney at Grossman, Human and Gossman from 1959 to 1964, and taught law at the University of Detroit Mercy and Wayne State University.

In 1961, Carl Levin married Barbara Halpern, who holds a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Michigan, a Master of Arts in mathematics from Colombia University, and a Bachelor of Laws from Wayne State University (1977). The Levins have three daughters -- Kate, Laura, and Erica.


Carl Levin left private law practice in 1964 to serve as general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission until 1967. He also served as special assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan and chief appellate defender for the city of Detroit (1968-1969). Levin began his political career in 1969 when he was elected to the Detroit Common Council, now the Detroit City Council (DCC). He served two four-year terms on the Council, including as President (1974-1977). During his tenure on DCC, Levin focused on issues such as discriminatory housing, lending, insurance practices, and redlining.

In 1978, Carl Levin, a member of the Democratic Party, was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating 13-year Republican incumbent Robert P. Griffin. During his tenure in the Senate, Levin served in many leadership roles including chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, co-chair of the Senate Auto Caucus, co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, and co-founder and chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management. Among Senator Levin’s legislative accomplishments were the Enron investigations, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, financial regulation, campaign finance reform, environmental protections including helping to establish Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Keweenaw National Historical Park, early opposition to the Iraq War of 2003, government ethics and lobbying reform, and appropriations for the U.S. Military. Levin authored many bills, was noted for his in-depth research and preparation for committee hearings, and traveled abroad extensively as chair of the Armed Services Committee.

After 36 years of service, Carl Levin retired from the Senate on January 3, 2015 as Michigan's longest serving U.S. Senator. Upon retirement, Levin established the Levin Center at Wayne State University Law School, where he served as chair and distinguished legislator in residence. He also took a senior counsel role at Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP.

1773,umich-bhl-8924,William G. Milliken Papers,"Republican governor of Michigan, 1969-1982. 

Papers include governor's office correspondence, administrative and subject files, staff files, materials relating to his campaigns for governor and Republican Party affairs, and a limited amount of photographs and sound recordings.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The William G. Milliken Papers is the most important source available for the study of Michigan's state government from 1969-1982. The collection currently measures 1478 linear feet and includes correspondence, memoranda, reports, agenda and minutes, briefing books, press releases and public statements, legal briefs and decisions, legislative bills and bill analyses, clippings, and printed works that pertain to Milliken's years as governor. Half of the papers arrived at the Bentley Historical Library in December 1982, from State Record Center retirement. Another portion came directly from the Capitol Complex at the end of Milliken's term. Several hundred feet arrived in 1983 from the governor's Traverse City office. Smaller accessions related to politics and political appointments were received in the late 1980s.

 Materials in the collection concern the official conduct of state government including the governor's role in legislative activity; the interface of state-federal jurisdictions; and the administration of the executive office, departments, commissions, and regional offices. The papers provide a rich resource for the study of executive response to concerns such as economic development, hazardous wastes, civil rights and affirmative action, labor, energy, minority populations, education, urban development, sex discrimination, and regional issues. As the governor remained active in the Republican party and sought election three times, the collection also includes materials on political matters. Files created by Milliken while Lieutenant Governor appear as well.","William Grawn Milliken was governor of Michigan from 1969-1982, the longest term in state history. A Yale-educated businessman and politician, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1964 and 1966, after serving four years in the State Senate, the last two as majority floor leader. He assumed the governorship on January 22, 1969, when George Romney resigned to become secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in Richard Nixon's cabinet. Michigan voters returned Milliken to office in the 1970, 1974, and 1978 elections. His first gubernatorial victory was narrow, with just a 44,000 vote margin. But citizen favor for him grew, and by 1978, his last test at the polls, Milliken won by nearly 400,000 votes. Many of his supporters were ticket-splitters or former Democrats.

 Although chief executive during the deepest economic crisis experienced in Michigan since the Depression, Governor Milliken was generally popular among both the people of the state and his political peers. A well-regarded politician, he chaired the National Governor's Association during 1977-1978 and the Midwest Governor's Association in 1974. He was the principal leader of the state GOP and a national force in the moderate wing of the Republican Party. Conservative elements within the party were often critical of the bipartisan, alliance-building style that led him to court labor, occasionally appoint Democrats to state jobs, and supported pro-choice legislation on abortion.

 Milliken led the state during a conflict-ridden era that frequently tested his ability as a crisis manager--for example, the General Motors strike of 1970, two Arab oil embargoes, contamination of the food chain with the toxic chemical PBB, and a controversy surrounding the state mental health system. He was admired for a firmness of conviction on issues that mattered greatly to him, such as the responsibility of government to cities, the arts, the environment, and the poor. The state revenue sharing program that helped Detroit during troubled economic times was adopted largely through Milliken's efforts. His administration was noted for its commitment to conservation and the passage of the Environmental Protection Act of 1970, which serve a model legislation throughout the nation; the budget stabilization fund and efforts at economic development; and, in the last days of his term, worker and unemployment compensation reforms and enactment of a transportation package. Milliken announced his decision not to seek reelection on December 22, 1981. After retiring from public office, he joined Chrysler Corporation's board of directors and chaired the Center for the Great Lakes, a private economic and environmental research center devoted to protecting regional lake resources.

 William Milliken was born in Traverse City on March 26, 1922, to James Thacker Milliken and Hildegarde Grawn. A waist-gunner on a World War II B-24 bomber, he received military honors, including the Purple Heart, for participation in 50 combat missions. From 1947-1955, he served on the Michigan Waterways Commission. The U.S. State Department selected him in 1953 to spend 75 days in West Germany in an intercultural exchange program and in 1971 to tour the Soviet Union and Romania. Governor Milliken is a past president of J.W. Milliken, Inc., a Michigan department store chain headquartered in Traverse City, with outlets in Manistee and Cadillac.

Papers consist of extensive correspondence and subject files from his tenure as governor, campaign material, and files relating to service at HUD and his other political activities, includes photographs, films and videotapes and sound recordings.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The papers of George Romney document the many faceted career of an automobile executive, governor of Michigan, candidate for President, cabinet officer, and activist on behalf of volunteerism. In this electronic version of the finding aid to the Romney papers, there are six subgroups of materials. These are Gubernatorial Papers covering the period of 1962 to 1969, Pre-gubernatorial Papers covering the period before taking office in 1963, Post-gubernatorial Papers covering the period after 1968, records of Romney Associates (a group established during his bid for the presidency), Visual Materials covering mainly the period up to 1969, and Sound Recordings also covering up to 1969. There is some overlapping of dates, particularly around the time when Romney was first elected governor in 1962 and the period when he joined the Nixon administration in 1969. The researcher should also note that the papers of Lenore Romney are not part of this finding aid.","George Romney was born on July 8, 1907 in Chihuahua, Mexico where his parents had gone to help establish a Mormon colony. Following missionary service in Scotland and England (1927-1928), Romney attended the University of Utah (1929) and George Washington University in Washington, D.C. (1929-1930). He served on the staff of U.S. Senator David I. Walsh in 1929-1930 as a tariff specialist, and afterward as an apprentice with the Aluminum Company of America and the Aluminum Wares Association. In 1931 he married Lenore LaFount.

 From 1939 to 1948 Romney was employed by the Automobile Manufacturer's Association, serving as general manager from 1942 to 1948. In 1948 he joined the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation, and in 1954 became chairman and president of the newly formed American Motors Corporation.

 In 1961, he was elected a Republican delegate to the Michigan Constitutional Convention, and served as its vice-president. In 1962, Romney decided to seek public office, announcing his candidacy for governor. He easily defeated Democratic incumbent John Swainson. A popular figure with the electorate, Romney was twice reelected. During the later part of his administration, he made a conscious bid for the Republican nomination for president. From about 1966 to 1968, George Romney, governor of Michigan, was an active candidate for the 1968 Republican nomination for president of the United States. Through most of 1967, Romney was in fact front-runner, but his candidacy rapidly faltered and Richard Nixon went on to become President.

 Although there have been many reasons advanced for the failure of George Romney's campaign, at least part of the problem can be ascribed to the organizational machinery set up on his behalf, first, to assess his chances, and then, second, to seek delegate support. The fault, according to some national commentators, was the bifurcation of the campaign into two separate, and often, competing organizational arms: Romney Associates, headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, and Romney for President, headquartered in Washington, D.C.

 Just when George Romney started thinking about the presidency is not clear. Perhaps the idea formed as a result of the national recognition he received from his leadership of American Motors in the 1950s. To this should be added his demonstrated voter appeal as evidenced by his overwhelming gubernatorial victories in 1962 and again in 1964. Party leaders were beginning to take Romney seriously. No wonder that sometime in 1965, Romney established a small office for himself in the Prudden Building in Lansing to answer the increasing correspondence he was receiving about national political issues, many of which urged him to run for president. After another resounding victory in 1966, Romney decided to have ""a hard look"" at his chances, and accordingly, he established Romney Associates, moving the files from the Prudden Building into an East Michigan Avenue office and shifting into leadership roles some of his most trusted political and administrative advisors, notably Robert J. McIntosh and Walter DeVries.

 As established, Romney Associates was responsible for research, speech writing, press and public relations, scheduling and travel arrangements, and responding to the governor's out-of-state correspondence. At about the same time, believing that he needed a national presence, Romney selected Leonard Hall, former Republican National Chairman, to organize in Washington, D.C. a Romney-for-President Committee. The functions assigned to the Hall group included overall campaign strategy, searching out delegates, bringing together the various state Romney for President groups, preparing mailing lists, maintaining cordial relations with influential members of Congress, and planning for the nominating convention. Perhaps in the two organizations lay the seed of Romney's collapse as a candidate. Because of their geographic separateness and the frequent overlapping of functions, the Romney campaign was marked by internal conflicts and inefficiency. The candidate himself received much of the criticism and his stand on various issues was not as clear-cut as should be expected. Added to this was the resurgence of Richard Nixon as a viable candidate. Unfairly, some might argue, Romney's campaign was dead soon after his official announcement in November 1967; and that following the New Hampshire primary, in February 1968, Romney merely went through the motions, hoping for a political miracle that was not to be.

 Following the election of Richard Nixon, Romney resigned as governor and went into the new president's cabinet as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. He resigned in 1972 to retire to private life. In his later years, Romney was active in the promotion of citizen involvement in government affairs.

Materials include audio and video recordings, briefings, correspondence, dashboards, meetings' agenda and minutes, memoranda, press releases, reports, subject files, and other records documenting Snyder's gubernatorial career and the work of his administration. ",The finding aid is written in English,"The Rick Snyder papers document the activities and policies of the executive  branch of Michigan's state government during Rick Snyder's two terms as governor. 

The collection documents a wide range of the administration's activities. It is particularly strong in documenting the governor’s efforts to stimulate Michigan's economy and urban centers, as well as the governor’s actions in the areas of education and the environment. Of note are the Appointments files regarding emergency managers in various Michigan cities, Chief of Staff materials on public health policy, and the Legal Division materials related to the state's interactions with Michigan’s Native American tribes.","Richard (Rick) Dale Snyder was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, on August 19, 1958. Snyder's father, Dale F. Snyder (1911-1991), was a local business owner; his mother, Helen L. (Howald) Snyder (1912-1993), was a homemaker. 

Snyder attended Lakeview High School, a public high school in Battle Creek. At 16, Snyder began taking weekend business classes at Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek.  Subsequently, he enrolled at U-M in January 1976 and graduated early with a Bachelor of General Studies degree in 1977. He went on to earn his M.B.A. in 1979 and his J.D. in 1982, both from U-M. He finished all three degrees by age 23.  After graduation, he became a certified public accountant (CPA) and a member of the Michigan Bar.

Snyder joined the Detroit office of Coopers & Lybrand as a tax accountant in 1982 and made partner by 1988. Between 1982 and 1984, Snyder also was an adjunct professor of tax and accounting in the U-M MBA program. While at Coopers & Lybrand, Snyder met his wife, Sue (Kerr) Snyder, a Dearborn, Michigan native. They were married in 1987. 

In 1991, the Snyders relocated to N. Sioux City, South Dakota, where Snyder joined the computer hardware company Gateway 2000 (subsequently renamed Gateway Inc.) as the executive vice president. He served as president and chief operating officer from 1996-1997, and a board member from 1997 – 2007  During this period, Gateway became a Fortune 500 Company growing from 600 people to 13,000 and $600mm in revenue to $6 billion.
After relocating to Ann Arbor in 1997, he founded a venture capital company, Avalon Investments, Inc. The following year, Snyder and U-M School of Public Health professor Victor Strecher co-founded Health Media Incorporated (HMI). HMI used questionnaires to gather personal information with the goal of creating individualized health promotion plans. 
In 2000, Snyder co-founded the venture capital and private equity company Ardesta LLC, which invested in start-ups that focused on developing micro- and nanotechnologies. Snyder was chairman and CEO of Ardesta until 2011. In 2005, Snyder was a leader of a group of Ann Arbor investors and community leaders who founded Ann Arbor SPARK, a non-profit economic development organization serving Washtenaw and Livingston counties.  He wrote Spark’s business plan and served as its first Chair.

In 2010, Rick Snyder ran as a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Using the slogan ""One Tough Nerd,"" Snyder's campaign introduced him as a businessman with a plan to reinvent Michigan through bipartisanship and his Ten Point Plan: ""leverage more and better jobs; leverage our new tax system; reinvent our government; keep our youth–our future–here; restore our cities; enhance our national and international image; protect our environment; revitalize our educational system; reinvent our health care system; winning in Michigan through Relentless Positive Action."" 

Rick Snyder won the November 2010 election, receiving 58% of the vote. Along with Snyder's election, Republicans gained a majority in the Michigan House and increased their majority in the Michigan Senate. His inauguration as Michigan's 48th governor took place on January 1, 2011. Rick Snyder was the first CPA elected governor of Michigan and only the second in the nation’s history. 

When Gov. Snyder took office, Michigan was at the bottom of almost every state ranking.  It had one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, it was the only state that lost population in the 2010 census, and it had a multiple billion-dollar budget deficit.  In two of the three years prior to his election, Michigan suffered government shutdowns due to the lack of timely budgets.

During his first term multiple reforms were made to make Michigan a better state.  The job crippling Michigan Business Tax was replaced with a simple, fair, and efficient corporate income tax encouraging job creation and investment in Michigan.  In 2012, Snyder signed legislation making Michigan a right to work state which significantly increased the pipeline of inbound investment in Michigan and created thousands of jobs.  The Secure Cities Partnership brought State Police resources to Michigan’s highest-crime cities, reducing violent crime by nearly 45% in Flint and bringing about an almost 45% decrease in property crime in Saginaw.  In 2014, Snyder launched the Healthy Michigan Plan which covered hundreds of thousands of formerly uninsured or underinsured Michiganders.  In subsequent years, the program grew to cover one million people.

A significant event of Gov. Snyder's first term was the bankruptcy and recovery of Detroit. In 2012, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing, the Detroit City Council, and Gov. Snyder agreed the state would help the city with its finances if the state government had greater fiscal oversight of the city. The City failed to accomplish any of their agreed upon improvements so in February 2013, Snyder announced that his administration would take financial control of Detroit. Following a declaration of financial emergency, the state's Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board appointed Kevyn Orr as Detroit's emergency manager. As emergency manager, Orr controlled all of Detroit's financial matters.  The city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July 2013.

One of the biggest debates during Detroit's bankruptcy was whether Detroit's cultural assets were available to creditors. This created a controversy over the possible sale of artwork from the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) to help pay off the city's debt. A plan nicknamed the ""Grand Bargain"" was developed to avoid the sale of the art, assist pensioners, and allow the city to exit bankruptcy. Under the terms of the ""Grand Bargain,"" multiple foundations and the State of Michigan donated funds to help reduce pension cuts caused by the bankruptcy. Detroit city retirees voted to accept the pension cuts, and the DIA was allowed to become an independent institution, preventing the artwork from being considered city-owned assets. The city exited bankruptcy on December 10, 2014, although it was still required to report to the state oversight board, the Financial Review Commission. 

In November 2014, Snyder was reelected Governor with 51% of the vote. 

The Flint water crisis dominated much of Snyder's second term. In 2014, Snyder appointed a series of emergency managers who had control over the city's finances – to address Flint’s long-standing financial problems.  The emergency manager agreed that Flint would join a new countywide water treatment system that drew water from Lake Huron. The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to support this change.  The new system was not yet completed, so as a stopgap measure the city begin drawing water from the Flint River in April 2014. 

State regulators failed to ensure that Flint city employees used proper corrosion control chemicals in the water. As a result, lead leached from old pipes running to many homes causing health problems among some Flint residents. Although residents raised concerns about the water quality, Flint officials, state officials, and the US EPA maintained that the water was safe to drink.  In September 2015, a Virginia Tech University research team released a report that confirmed Flint's water had dangerously elevated levels of lead. In January 2016, Snyder declared a state of emergency in Genesee County, which was shortly followed by President Barack Obama's declaration of a federal state of emergency. Snyder implemented a 75-point action plan investing over $300 million addressing the water crisis.  Snyder also apologized for his administration’s role in the crisis.  In 2019, Snyder was charged with willful neglect of duty along with other charges against several other officials. In December 2023, all charges were formally dismissed.  As of September 2022, 95 percent of the lead pipes had been replaced with modern infrastructure.  In 2024, the City of Flint was found in contempt of court for its slow role in the lead pipe replacement.

In July 2018, the construction of the Gordie Howe International Bridge began, a second bridge over the Detroit River to Canada. Snyder enabled the building of the bridge by signing a unique agreement with Canada where Canada provided funding for the entire bridge.  In 2018, Snyder signed into law a package of bills strengthening protections against sexual abuse of children and creating anti-bullying statutes that included cyberbullying. From 2011-2018, Michigan passed balanced budgets several months earlier than required.  All three major rating agencies raised Michigan’s credit rating, and the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund (aka Rainy-Day Fund) reached $1 billion by 2018, up from $2.2 million in 2011. 
During Snyder’s time as Governor, Michigan grew again in population, it recorded low unemployment, leading increases in per capita income, and became an inbound state for the migration of working age adults.  Over the eight-year period, 87% of the bills signed by Snyder had bipartisan support in both legislative chambers.

Snyder returned to private life in Ann Arbor at the end of his term in 2018. He established the company RPAction LLC.

2491,umich-bhl-8667,John B. Swainson Papers,"Democratic governor of Michigan, 1961-1963; gubernatorial office files, campaign files, papers from his career as state senator and lieutenant governor.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The John B. Swainson collection consists of four subgroups of files: pre-gubernatorial (covering the period of 1943 to 1960), gubernatorial (covering his one-term, two-year tenure as the state's chief executive), post-gubernatorial (covering the years since he left the governor's office, 1963 to 1975), and visual materials.

 The great bulk of the collection is the gubernatorial subgroup documenting the last months of Swainson's term as lieutenant governor under Governor G. Mennen Williams, the 1960 campaign for governor, his gubernatorial administration, and his unsuccessful campaign for re-election. The importance of the collection, as with all gubernatorial records, is its documentation of public policy issues of the early 1960s and the relationship of the governor to the legislature, to the heads of the state's various boards and commissions, to the federal government, and to the citizens of Michigan.","John B. Swainson was born July 31, 1925 in Windsor, Ontario. He grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, where he attended the public schools and was active in sports. During World War II, he served with the 95th Infantry Division under General George S. Patton. Severely wounded by a land mine explosion, Swainson lost both of his legs to amputation.

 Upon his discharge from the service, Swainson entered Olivet College. Here he met and married Alice Nielsen of Detroit, Michigan. Moving to North Carolina for medical reasons, Swainson attended and graduated from the University of North Carolina (LLB; 1951). Upon graduation, Swainson returned to Michigan and set up law practice in Detroit.

 In Michigan Swainson demonstrated his interest in Democratic politics. In 1954, he was elected to the Michigan Senate from the 18th District (the northwest section of Wayne County). He was reelected in 1956 and developed a close working relationship with Democratic governor, G. Mennen Williams. In 1958, he was elected lieutenant governor; and in 1960, after Williams decided against reelection, Swainson won his party's nomination for governor. In the fall election, he defeated the Republican challenger Paul Bagwell in a close election. He became at age 35 the second youngest man to hold the office of governor and the first who was not native born.

 During his term in office, Swainson sought to carry out the Democratic program of his predecessor, G. Mennen Williams. The debate focused primarily on finances and the need to overhaul the state's system of taxation. As it stood, monies for state government were raised through an inequitable combination of sales and property taxes. Swainson urged passage of a comprehensive package of fiscal and tax reform legislation that would shift the burden of taxation off the poor and middle class and onto businesses and the state's wealthier citizens. A cornerstone of his program was a state income tax, but because of Republican opposition in the legislature, the Swainson tax package was defeated. One result of the defeat was that local communities (notably Detroit), strapped for funds, began implementing their own city income tax ordinances. When the suburbs of Detroit drafted legislation (the Bowman bill) that would have prevented cities such as Detroit from taxing non-residents whose place of employment was in the city, Swainson vetoed the bill. As a consequence in the following election, he lost a substantial portion of the suburban vote that was to have been critical to his reelection.

 Because of the opposition of the Republican legislature, the Swainson administration is known less for the legislation passed during his term than for his use of the office of governor, first through his power to veto what he termed ""special interest"" legislation and secondly, through his power to issue executive orders. Notable examples of Swainson executive orders provided for the establishment of the first Michigan Commission on the Status of Women, the implementation of a Governor's Code of Fair Employment Practices for all state agencies, the creation of a ""Keep Michigan Beautiful"" organization devoted to environmental matters, and the appointment of the Governor's Constitutional Convention Preparatory Commission. Swainson also used the prestige of his office to articulate his liberal, Democratic beliefs. As governor of an important northern state, Swainson was forthright in the press and at various Governors' conferences in his support of the civil rights movement and vocal in his abhorrence of the segregationist practices of the south.

 Undoubtedly, the most important event of Swainson's administration was the calling of a constitutional convention. Michigan then operated under a 1908 constitution which was badly outdated and was blamed by many for the state's inability to solve its financial difficulties during the 1950s. During 1960 and before, citizen groups gathered petitions, and in April 1961, the people voted to call a constitutional convention. A primary election was held in July and a general election of delegates in September. The convention itself was seated from October through May 1962. During the summer months, an address to the people was prepared, and then on August 1, 1962, the convention reassembled to vote on this address and the slight changes that had been recommended in the preceding weeks. The convention again approved the document, then adjourned. The constitution was submitted to a vote of the people in April 1963 where it passed by an uncomfortably narrow margin.

 Swainson's election in 1960 was close; in 1962, he was opposed by the popular automobile executive George Romney. Swainson lost, and contributing to his defeat, in addition to Romney's popularity, were the state's continuing financial woes and the fact that the Michigan's chief executive had been a Democrat since 1948.

 In April 1965, Swainson was elected judge of the Third Circuit and reelected in 1966. In June 1969. Swainson and a group of concerned citizens founded NARCO (Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Co-ordinating Organization), a citizens organization formed to co-ordinate the efforts of various fragmented groups and programs attempting to combat the growing problem of drug use and abuse. On November 3, 1970, Swainson was elected to an 8-year term on the Michigan Supreme Court. In January 1973, he was selected to serve as Deputy Chief Justice. He resigned from office in 1975 following his conviction by a federal jury of perjury during an investigation into a charge that as justice he had accepted a bribe.

 After serving a brief 60 day sentence in a Detroit halfway house, Swainson retired to private life. When his license to practice law was restored, he worked as a mediator and arbitrator, and became active in the Michigan Historical Commission, serving for a time as its president.

Warner Papers date from 1945 to 2007. These materials primarily highlight Warner's lengthy professional career, documenting his various teaching and administrative positions at the University of Michigan, his appointment as Archivist of the United States and the subsequent administration at the National Archives. Also documented is the appointment of his successor at the National Archives, his return to the University of Michigan as Dean of the School of Information and Library Science, and his activities on various boards and foundations after his retirement. Much of the records documenting his tenure as the director of the Michigan Historical Collections (now the Bentley Historical Library) can be found under the official Bentley Historical Library record group.

Warner collection has been divided into ten series: Biography; Correspondence; Indian Court Claims; National Archives; School of Information and Library Science and Dean of the Michigan Library Systems; Teaching Materials and Scholarly Research; Professional Activities, Speeches; Scrapbooks and Scrapbook Materials, and Audio-Visual Material.","Archivist, historian and professor, Robert Mark Warner was born on June 28, 1927, in Montrose, Colorado, son of Mark Thomas and Bertha Margaret (Rich) Warner. Warner completed his undergraduate work in history at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio in 1949. It was here he met Eleanor Jane Bullock, whom he married in 1954. After a year as a high school teacher of history and speech in Montrose, he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he served in Germany, from 1950 to 1952, during the Korean War. Upon his return, Warner continued his education at the University of Michigan where he earned an M.A. (1953) and a Ph.D. (1958) in history. Warner's studies concentrated on ""recent"" history (then defined as 1876 to the 1950s). After completing his doctoral degree, Warner joined the faculty of the history department of the University of Michigan where he taught Michigan history. In 1974, he was invited by Dean Russell Bidlack to join the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Library Science and inaugurate the archival studies program.

 Warner's association with archives began during his early years as a graduate student, when he used the University of Michigan's Michigan Historical Collections (MHC) to do research. When a position as a research assistant in the Collections became available, Warner took his first step down a completely different road than he had imagined his career would take. During his years at the MHC, he was active in several professional archival organizations, including the International Council on Archives (ICA) and the Society of American Archivists (SAA). Warner was particularly active in SAA, where he served on the Council, as secretary, director, vice president and president, as well as many committees. By 1966, Warner had become director of the MHC (now known as the Bentley Historical Library), a position that he held until his appointment as Archivist of the United States in 1980.

 When Warner arrived at the National Archives and Records Services (NARS) in July of 1980, the organization had been without leadership for nearly a year, since the resignation of his predecessor James B. (Bert) Rhoads in 1979. Warner described the atmosphere that greeted him as one of demoralization and high tension. Friction had developed between NARS and its parent organization, the General Services Administration (GSA), over perceived interference and inappropriate intervention of GSA in archival matters. GSA Administrator Admiral Roland G. Freeman's plan to relocate federal records to regional Federal Records Centers around the country caused uproar in NARS and among scholars and archival and historical organizations around the country. NARS also faced an investigation by Congress and the Executive Branch over preservation activities and suffered from management problems.

 Warner's major accomplishment as Archivist of the U.S. was to secure the independence of the National Archives from GSA. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt had originally created the National Archives as an independent agency in 1934, by the 1950s it had become a subdivision of the GSA. As early as 1968, a movement to free NARS from the GSA had been launched, but quickly foundered. Bills were introduced in the Senate in 1980 and 1981, but failed to come to a vote. In 1982, the Smithsonian Study came out, recommending autonomy, but was rejected by GSA Administrator Gerald Carmen. By 1983 it had become clear to Warner that NARS could no longer remain a captive of GSA if it was to be an effective organization. With the support of Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon and several other key figures in Washington, the National Archives and Administration Act of 1983 was introduced in the Senate on March 23, 1983 (S. 905). In September, the bill was introduced in the House as H.R. 3987. As the bill made its way through congress, Warner worked behind the scenes, generating support and attention from such organizations as SAA, the American Historical Association and such figures as Barbara Tuchman, Alex Haley and Ed Meese. In June of 1984, the Senate passed the bill, followed by the House in August. After going to conference, the Senate and the House passed the revised bill on October 3 and 4, 1984, respectively. President Ronald Reagan signed the Act on October 19, 1984, creating the independent National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), effective April 1, 1985.

 Other highlights of Warner's years at NARS included the completion of a twenty-year preservation plan in 1984, the creation of a technology assessment division, the completion of the appraisal and retention plan for FBI records in 1981, controversy over the Richard Nixon Presidential papers, as well as the founding of the Carter Library and planning of the Ronald Reagan Library.

 By the end of 1984, Warner had decided to resign his position as Archivist of the U.S. in order to return to the University of Michigan, where he would become Dean of the School of Information and Library Studies (SILS). Warner stayed on at NARS until April 1985, after which he took up his new position at the University of Michigan. Under Warner's leadership, SILS revised its master and PhD programs and emphasized faculty research and minority hiring, moved to a new location at West Hall, fully re-organized its staff structure. From 1988 to 1991, Warner also served as acting director of the University of Michigan Library and was given the lifetime title of University Historian. He retired from the deanship in 1992, and was succeeded by Daniel Atkins.

 Warner spent one year teaching at the School of Library and Information Science at UCLA. He was also involved with the National Library of Education Task Force and actively served on the University of Michigan History and Traditions Committee. Warner also served on two General Accounting Office (GAO) committees, the Research and Education Panel (REAP) and the History Advisory Program, as well as the Foundation of the National Archives. From 1986 to 2007 Warner served on various boards and committees including the Executive Committee of the University of Michigan Library, Clarke Historical Library, Presbyterian Historical Society and others. He was also secretary for the Gerald R. Ford Foundation

 In 1995, Warner published a memoir on his experience at the National Archives called ""Diary of a Dream."" In 2005, Dr. Warner was honored for his lasting contribution to the National Archives with the naming of the Robert M. Warner Research Center at the newly renovated downtown building, in Washington, D.C.

There is also an extensive series of scrapbooks detailing his professional and civic activities and several folders of photographs.","Carl M. Weideman was born in Detroit, Michigan on March 5, 1898. He was a student at the University of Michigan from 1914 to 1916. With the outbreak of World War I, he attended the Naval Officers Training School, then enlisted in the United States Navy as an apprentice seaman. From 1918 to 1922, he was a member of the United States Naval Reserve. For much of this time, Weideman was able to continue his studies, graduating from the Detroit College of Law in 1921.

 Weideman was a successful trial attorney throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1932 he became politically active winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan's 14th Congressional District, which included Detroit's east side and the Grosse Pointes. While serving in Congress, he was a member of the Immigration and Naturalization, District of Columbia, and Un-American Activities committees. Weideman was a one-term Congressman failing to receive his party's nomination for re-election in 1934. He was elected a Wayne County Circuit Court commissioner in 1936 and served in that position until 1950 when he was appointed to the Wayne County Circuit bench by Governor G. Mennen Williams.

2803,umich-bhl-86396,Peter White Papers,"Marquette, Michigan businessman, Democratic state senator, and Republican regent of the University of Michigan. Letterbooks and correspondence relating to activities in the Democratic Party in Michigan, particularly in the Upper Peninsula, to his service within the state legislature, and to state and national elections, 1876-1896; also correspondence and other records concerning his extensive business interests that include Northern Michigan iron, insurance, banking, and general investments.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The collection documents the development of the economy of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan from the perspective of one of its pioneer entrepreneurs. Through correspondence and other business records, there is documentation of White's extensive business interests in Northern Michigan iron, insurance, and banking. Other portions of the collection concern his service in the state legislature and his involvement in state and national elections, 1876-1896.

 Peter White's correspondence, the largest portion of the collection, has been divided into two series: correspondence/business papers and insurance correspondence. The papers for 1850-1853 deal with White's activities as clerk for Robert Graveraet. Also discussed in this early period are legal matters with some material on his work as postmaster and various family matters. The correspondence for 1854-1862 deals with early mining companies with whom he had association and provides some information about the financial aspect of various organizations. White acted as a marketing agent for several companies and this aspect is covered well. The term served by White in the state legislature is covered very sparsely.

 Beginning in 1863 White activities expand to encompass insurance and banking concerns. While the iron interest is well represent in the papers for 1863-1873, insurance and banking occupy an increasingly important place. After 1874, White's insurance business is heavily represented in the correspondence. Banking also continues to occupy an important place but the iron companies are far less frequently a subject of discussion. Local politics is also discussed in the correspondence for 1874-1891. As someone who had been actively engaged in politics and public service, White commented on state and national election campaigns from the 1870s to the 1890s. Most notable are letters exchanged pertaining to the campaign of Williams Jennings Bryan in the presidential election of1896. Beginning in 1902, the insurance correspondence decrease and the investment phase of White's career make itself evident. After 1900 correspondence with the University of Michigan and its history department becomes more important.

 The remainder of the collection consists of Business Records, divided between folder records and bound records. Each of these series includes records of specific companies with whom Peter White was associated. These include the Phenix Iron Mining Company, the Michigan God Company, the Manhard-Jopling Company, the Lake Superior Leather Company, and the Schoolcraft Iron Company.","Peter White was born at Rome, New York on October 31, 1830. Around 1838, he moved with his family to Green Bay, Wisconsin. At age fourteen, he left home to seek his fortune first in Mackinac Island, then later in Detroit where he was employed as a clerk in a general merchandising firm. White remained in Detroit for a brief period of time then returned to Mackinac Island, again working as clerk. In 1849, he joined a party headed by Robert J. Graveraet to explore the newly discovered Iron Mountains of Lake Superior. Settling in the region, White became one of the first settlers of Marquette and it was here that he would make his fortune. In 1850, he took charge for the Marquette Iron Company of its general trading store. With the postoffice in the rear of the store, White also served as postmaster for the young community. In 1853, he commenced his banking business establishing the firm of Peter White &amp; Co. This later in 1863 became the First National Bank of Marquette.

 In the midst of this activity, White studied and practiced law. In 1856, White and Matthew H. Maynard formed a partnership to sell insurance and practice law. The difficulty which the partners faced in their insurance endeavor was finding insurance companies willing to risk the hazards of insuring a wilderness community like Marquette. In addition to problems associated with fire insurance, marine insurance for the transport of pig iron and iron ore was an essential ingredient in the burgeoning economic growth of the area. White early realized the resource riches of the Marquette area sought to involve himself in every aspect of the iron mining business, not just insurance but also finance, production and marketing.

 White also had various political and civic responsibilities. In 1857, he was elected to the state house of representatives as a Democrat from the Upper Peninsula;and in 1875, he was elected to the state senate. Additionally, in 1892-1893, he was a member of the Board of World's Fair Managers for Michigan; also he was a member of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, and a member of the State Board of Library Commissioners. In 1903, he was elected as a Republican to the board of regents of the University of Michigan. He died June 6, 1908.",10825; 10826; 10827; 10828; 10829; 6207; 6268; 6269; 9780; 6208; 9572; 9782; 6251; 10830; 6130; 6097; 8854; 7096; 10831; 6740; 8031,American newspapers; American newspapers; Banks and banking; Depressions; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; General stores; Indians of North America; Insurance; Iron mines and mining; Land use; Manufactures; Railroads; Shipping,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3142,Photographs.,aat,1105; 2513; 1000; 1936; 885; 806; 807; 808; 3097; 1001; 910; 939,"Grand Rapids (Mich.); Ishpeming (Mich.); Marquette (Mich.); Marquette County (Mich.); Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Presque Isle (Marquette, Mich.); Sault Sainte Marie Canal (Mich.); United States; Upper Peninsula (Mich.)",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; local; local; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,6775; 3897; 6775; 6775; 7785; 2789; 2194; 5993; 6248; 8892; 2806; 4439; 154; 5192; 3523; 3899; 6252; 2497; 2738; 783; 5822; 1171; 4615,"White, Peter, 1830-1908; Chandler, Zachariah, 1813-1879; White, Peter, 1830-1908; White, Peter, 1830-1908; Adams, Henry Carter, 1851-1921; Angell, James Burrill, 1829-1916; Baldwin, Henry P.

1038,umich-bhl-86393,G. Mennen Williams Papers,"Governor of Michigan 1949 to 1960, under-secretary of state for African Affairs from 1961 to 1965, and Michigan Supreme Court justice from 1970 to 1986 and leader in state and national Democratic Party. Papers document his public career and aspects of his personal and family life and include correspondence, subject files, staff files, speeches, press releases and news clippings, photographs, sound recordings, films and videotapes.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The G. Mennen Williams Papers consist of official and personal files arranged into six subgroups: 1) Gubernatorial papers, 1949-1960 (681 linear ft.); 2) Non-gubernatorial papers, 1883-1948 and 1958-1988 (107 linear ft.); 3) Visual materials, ca. 1911-1988 (ca. 25 linear ft.); 4) sound recordings, 1950-ca. 1988 (5 linear ft.) Scrapbooks, 1948-1987 (43 vols.) and State Department Microfilm, 1961-1966 (23 reels).

 As part of its own control system, the governor's office maintained a card index to the correspondents in many of the subgroups and series within the gubernatorial papers. This card file is located in the library's reading room. In addition, Nancy Williams and her staff compiled an extensive and detailed run of scrapbooks covering the Williams years. There is a separate inventory to these scrapbooks in a separately bound volume.

 Strategy for Use of the Gubernatorial Papers: Although the Williams gubernatorial collection consists of hundreds of linear feet of material, the file arrangement created by the governor's staff is a fairly simple one to understand and to use.

 The bulk of the collection falls within specific functional groupings, corresponding to the various activities and responsibilities that Williams performed as governor. Thus, if the researcher is uncertain of what portions of the collection might be relevant to his/her research, he/she is advised to think in terms of gubernatorial function. Does the proposed research concern the workings or area responsibility of a state board? If so, the Boards and Commissions series would be the most likely place in which to find material. The election of 1954? Then Democratic Party/Campaign Papers should be first choice. The passage of a specific piece of legislation? Here, Legislative Files is an obvious choice. The possible choices (called subgroups and series) that the researcher has are listed in the Organization of the Collection section. A description of the contents of each of these subgroups/series is provided below.

 If, at first, unsuccessful in finding material on any given topic, the researcher might consider these additional strategies:

 1. Refer to the Williams card index (located in the library's reading room). Sometimes, the name of an individual associated with a subject provides the easiest point of access into the collection. This file is arranged alphabetically and lists the dates of letters between an individual and the governor's office. This file only indexes the larger series and subgroups in the collection. It does not index the staff files, or parts of the Democratic Party/Campaign subgroup. Nevertheless it is an invaluable tool, and can uncover important material otherwise buried.

 2. Refer to the various series of staff papers. Staff members were often closely involved in a specific subject areas (Jordan Popkin and aging, for example) and thus their files are frequently rich in source material.

 3. If only partially successful in locating desired material, the researcher should think of an alternative subgroup or series. The governor's office, for a variety of reasons, often filed related material in different locations depending upon the source of a document. Thus, information relating to a strike might be filed both under the Labor Mediation Board in Boards and Commissions, and Strikes in General Subjects. Furthermore, if the strike influenced a specific piece of legislation, there could be material in the Legislative Files.","G. Mennen Williams was a man born to privilege but who devoted his life to public service. His career included stints as governor of Michigan from 1949 to 1960, under-secretary of state for African Affairs from 1961 to 1965, and Michigan Supreme Court justice from 1970 to 1986. Williams was born in Detroit, February 23, 1911, to Henry P. and Elma Mennen Williams. After prepping at the Salisbury School in Connecticut, he received his AB degree at Princeton in 1933. Williams finished his formal education by taking a JD degree from the University of Michigan in 1936.

 Williams began his career as an attorney for the Social Security Board in Washington, D. C. In 1938 he returned to Michigan to serve as assistant attorney general under Raymond Starr. His public career took him back to Washington where he acted as executive assistant to United States Attorney General Frank Murphy, from 1939 to 1940. He continued to work for Murphy until 1941 as special assistant in the Criminal Division.

 With American entry into World War II, Williams' public service took a new form. Despite being thirty-one years old and the father of a young son, Williams sought and gained a commission as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He saw active duty as an air combat intelligence officer in the Pacific theater. After his discharge in 1946, Williams served as deputy director of the Office of Price Administration for Michigan until 1947. He then took a position as the Democratic member of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission and used this post to build a network of supporters for his gubernatorial campaign in 1948.

 Williams was elected governor of Michigan on the Democratic ticket in November 1948. The result was something of an upset in that Michigan was a strongly Republican state. Williams continued to upset Michigan Republicans, narrowly winning re-election in 1950, then winning the 1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958 elections. His re-election in 1958 gave him an unprecedented sixth consecutive term.

 By not running for state office in 1960, Williams left himself available to serve the nation as a whole. At one time thought to be under consideration for the vice-presidency, Williams was eventually tapped by President Kennedy to serve as undersecretary of state for African Affairs. Williams held this post until 1966 when he decided to campaign for the U.S. Senate; he lost to Robert Griffin. Williams returned to the public sphere when President Johnson appointed him ambassador to the Philippines in 1967. He held this post until Richard Nixon became president in January 1969.

 Williams resumed his career of public service to the state of Michigan by winning election to the State Supreme Court in 1970. He headed a reform movement within the judiciary to make administration of justice ""effective and efficient."" He served so capably during his first term that he was easily re-elected in 1978 and was elected Chief Justice by his peers in April 1983. Williams retired from the bench in 1987 and died February 2, 1988. He was survived by his wife, Nancy Quirk Williams, and three children, Gery, Nancy, and Wendy.",5793; 5987; 4080; 3834; 3835; 5987; 6574; 6911; 6320; 6567; 6190; 6191; 6582; 5987,Judges; Governors; Political elections.; Politics and government; Politics and government; Governors; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Elections; Governors,lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3482; 3475; 3463; 3142; 3466; 3140; 3144; 3141,Caricatures.; Drawings.; Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Tintypes.; Scrapbooks.; Sound recordings.; Videotapes.,gmgpc; gmgpc; gmgpc; aat; gmgpc; aat; aat; aat,1281; 811; 812; 803; 804; 944; 1916; 1917; 1278; 1281; 1378; 944; 1918; 811; 812; 1919; 1916; 1917,Africa.; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Michigan; Philippines; United States; United States; United States; Africa.; Mackinac Bridge (Mich.); Philippines; Africa; Michigan; Michigan; Philippines; United States; United States,lcsh; local; local; local; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; local; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,193; 3938; 8205; 8205; 1323; 3227; 8255; 7919; 9108; 5401; 2417; 5010; 893; 8205; 3938; 8205; 1804; 8713; 8495; 8316; 7375; 6221; 2804; 4188; 3042; 3864; 7229; 4297; 5129; 7813; 8255; 7919; 2151; 3490; 3037; 7614; 2507; 1128; 917; 8794; 5603; 6218; 1674,"Williams, G.

Brandt Papers,"Philosopher and ethicist, professor at the University of Michigan 1964-1981, papers include notes, writings, course materials and correspondence.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The collection is primarily comprised of papers which document the breadth and depth of Brandt's investigations into philosophical questions -- including notes, writings, commentary on collected works of others, and teaching materials. Except for a few correspondence files, there is little of a personal nature, and there are no records representing Brandt's tenure as chair of the Philosophy Department at the University of Michigan. Papers include detailed course materials (particularly on moral philosophy); published and unpublished writings on a range of philosophical issues; and extensive commentary on readings. Researchers should note that there is considerable overlap between the various series. Correspondence, for example, is often associated with an article or included in a topical file; research notes and topical files frequently contain similar subject matter; and articles and manuscripts sometimes include research notes. These overlaps are evidence of Brandt's integrated approach to his life's work -- research, teaching, and writing, as well as much of his correspondence, each influencing and informing the other.","Richard B. Brandt (1935-1996), one of the most influential moral philosophers of the second half of the twentieth century, taught at the University of Michigan for seventeen years, assuming chairmanship of the Department of Philosophy upon his arrival in 1964. During his academic career, he was a fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation, a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California, and a Senior Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He served as President of the American Philosophical Association, western division, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. A prolific writer, Brandt authored nearly one hundred articles and six books. In 1974, he was selected to give the John Locke lectures at Oxford University, which became the basis for <title render=""italic"">A Theory of the Good and the Right</title> published in 1979, considered his crowning achievement in ethics.

 Brandt was born in Wilmington, Ohio on October 17, 1910 and graduated from Denison University in 1930. Following graduation, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge University, where he received a BA in 1934, followed by two years of study at Tuebingen University. After returning to the United States, he received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Yale University in 1936. He taught philosophy at Swarthmore College before coming to Michigan, where he was later named the Roy Wood Sellars Distinguished College Professor of Philosophy. Although he retired in 1977, Brandt continued to teach as visiting professor at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Affairs at the University of Maryland, Florida State University, the Georgetown University Law Center, and University of California-Irvine.

 Brandt's major philosophical interests were in ethics and in the nature and origin of knowledge. He also had strong interests in psychology and anthropology as they influenced or reflected ethical values - evidenced particularly in his 1954 publication <title render=""italic"">Hopi Ethics: A Theoretical Analysis</title> which was based upon meticulous research in Arizona on the Hopi people. Brandt's interest in drawing upon a vast range of learning expanded the scope of contemporary philosophy. In modern psychology, for example, he explored theories of motivation, learning and psychotherapy.

 Unconfined to traditional foundations of ethics, Brandt worked on a wide range of philosophical problems and on public moral issues such as suicide, the rules of war, defective newborns, and welfare policies. According to a colleague, Brandt insisted that, ""Traditional philosophical questions ... are often confused, and a philosopher must work to identify what is clear and important in them... [Brandt] rejected appeals to 'intuition,' and worked to find better ways to support philosophical conclusions. [He] was creative and insightful in reformulating questions, proposing solutions to them and arguing for his positions ... always determined to get to the root of an issue."" Decision making for complex problems, according to Brandt, is time consuming, but as the proverb goes, ""Decide in haste, repent at leisure.""

 Brandt's theory of the good and the right, which evolved over several decades and appeared at various stages of its evolution in numerous articles and two major books, was intended to address - and to recommend itself - to the present age. In 1959, he set forth in <title render=""italic"">Ethical Theory</title> his highly regarded form of rule-utilitarianism. Rule-utilitarianism, a leading theory of moral right and wrong, bases answers to questions essentially on the benefits that flow from the widespread acceptance of moral rules in a society - a moral system that is ""welfare maximizing"" (which Brandt believed carries inherent implications for law and government). The volume, considered a primary source in moral philosophy, was translated into Italian, Spanish and Polish. In a second book, <title render=""italic"">A Theory of the Good and the Right</title> published in 1979, Brandt asked, ""Why should philosophers not actively introduce definitions which enable people to think more clearly and disabuse them of misconception?"" One of the clarifying functions of a philosopher Brandt believed, is to offer more precise and useful definitions of words. It was his view that the philosopher can play a useful role by evaluating and ordering the philosophical principles underlying function, including, for example, legislation. ""Taking a broad view,"" he said, ""could have spin-offs -- suggest options which otherwise would not have been thought of, or make the dilemmas seem less serious by placing them in perspective.""

 Brandt's last monograph <title render=""italic"">Facts, Values and Morality</title> was published just a year before he died in 1996. In a University Record tribute in 1997, Allan F. Gibbard, the Richard B. Brandt Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, spoke to Brandt's contribution to philosophical scholarship: ""Richard Brandt was one of the most eminent and influential moral philosophers of his generation. His books were landmarks, and he was prolific with important articles to the very end of his long life. His writing was always careful and clear, trenchant and imaginative.""

 Richard Brandt delighted in discussion on wide ranging issues with department colleagues and with those from other disciplines and in the community. He was a lunch-time regular from its inception at the ""Ethics Roundtable,"" a weekly discussion group at the Michigan League, which he initially organized. Brandt had a son, Richard, a daughter, Karen, and two grandchildren, Jared and Kristen.",6493; 6494; 6495; 6496; 6497,Ethics.; Hopi Indians.; Philosophy; Philosophy; Philosophy.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,,,,,,,65; 65,"Brandt, Richard B.; Brandt, Richard B.",lcnaf; lcnaf,704; 4310,University of Michigan.

 After graduating from the Peru, Nebraska, State Teachers College in 1930, she received her M.S. degree in 1932 and Ph.D. degree in 1935 from the University of Michigan. She then joined the Michigan faculty, rising through the ranks to become curator in the Botanical Gardens in 1957 and professor of botany in 1960. She helped to establish the cactus and succulent collection at the Botanical Gardens and also taught at the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, Mich.

 During her career, Clover made frequent expeditions to the Southwest. In 1938, she was a member of the Norman Nevill party which traveled the Colorado River from Green River, Utah through Cataract and Grand canyons to Boulder Dam. Clover made the trip to catalog the flora of the Grand Canyon. She brought along Lois Jotter, a botany graduate student as her assistant. This trip, starting in July of 1938, lasted 43 days and covered 666 miles. The trip brought publicity and recognition to Nevill not only for successfully running the entire length of the Colorado River, but by having the first women aboard ever to complete the run of the entire Grand Canyon.

 Clover was a member of numerous professional societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Botanical Society of America, and Michigan Academy of Science.

He earned his bachelor's degree with high honors in anthropology from Oberlin College in 1963. Ford then attended the University of Michigan for graduate work in anthropology (MA, 1965, PhD, 1968), where he worked with influential American anthropologist James B. Griffin, and studied ethnobotany under the guidance of distinguished ethnobotanist Volney H. Jones.

 Ford began his academic career as an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati (1967-1968). Following his work there, Ford embarked upon a long and distinguished career at the University of Michigan in the anthropology and botany departments, where he worked from 1969 until his retirement in 2007. Ford began his career at Michigan as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 1972, and earned the rank of full professor in 1977. In addition to his dual teaching appointments, Ford served as a faculty associate at the Institute for the Humanities and the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Over the course of his career, Ford also served as a visiting professor at numerous other institutions, including Utah State University (1981); University of Washington (1986); Kunming Institute of Botany in Xishunghanna, China (1987), Southern Methodist University (1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1999); and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City, Mexico (1994).

 At the University of Michigan, Ford worked outside the classroom as the curator of ethnology (1969-1978), assistant director (1972-1975) and director (1975-1983 and 2002-2005) of Michigan's Museum of Anthropology, chair of the Department of Anthropology (1989-1996), and associate dean for research and computing in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (1987-1989). He also served on the executive committees of the university's Institute for Social Research (1991-1998), the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies (1992-1993), and the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project (2002-2006).

 Ford was a member and office holder in numerous professional societies including the American Anthropological Association; the American Association of the Advancement of Science; the Society for American Archaeology, the Council on Michigan Archaeology; the Council for Museum Anthropology; the Society for Economic Botany, the Society of Ethnobiology; the International Society for Ethnobiology; and the Baca Institute of Ethnobotany. He also engaged in national service as a member of the National Science Foundation's Systematic Research Collections Panel; board member of the Archaeological Conservancy, Inc.; committee member on the National Anthropological Conservation Curriculum Committee for the National Institute for Conservation; advisory board member for the Herb Research Foundation and the American Association of Museum; and grant reviewer for the National Endowment for the Humanities.

 Ford's research interests include ethnobotany from an ethnoecological perspective, paleoethnobotany, subsistence patterns, plant management techniques, origins of domesticated plants, prehistoric agricultural systems in Mexico and the Southwest United States, archaeology of the Archaic, and rock art. He engages in applied ethnobotany through work with various Indian Pueblo nations in the Southwest. As one of the preeminent ethnobotanists working today, Ford has contributed significantly to understandings of how native peoples in North American managed and utilized medicines, plants, foods, and cultural symbols.

 Ford utilized his research in his work as an expert witness and consultant. He has assisted the Hopi Tribe in its water rights case (1987), served as an expert witness to the Zuni Pueblo in its land dispute (1983-1985), acted as a water rights consultant for the Taos Tribe (1997), and participated in the development of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).

He received an Associate in Science certificate from North Texas Agricultural College in 1927 and a B.A. in agriculture from Texas A&amp;M; University in 1929. He then enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Biology at the University of New Mexico, studying ethnobotany under Edward Castetter. Jones was awarded a master's degree in 1931.

 In 1931, Jones left New Mexico to take a position as a student assistant in the Ethnobotanical Laboratory at the University of Michigan's Museum of Anthropology, working under Melvin Gilmore. With Gilmore in poor health, Jones was called upon to take over much of the work of the lab almost from the earliest days of his appointment. When Gilmore died in 1940, Jones became head of the lab and the museum's ethnographic collections, though he did not receive the full official title of Curator of Ethnology until 1945. Jones also taught in the Department of Anthropology, and was particularly known for his popular course on Native Americans. He was named assistant professor in 1945 and associate professor in 1952. Jones held these positions until his retirement in 1969. Jones spent his entire professional career at Michigan, though he took a fifteen-month leave of absence from the university to work in rubber production in Haiti during World War II.

 The Ethnobotanical Laboratory served as a central facility for researchers throughout the country to send ethnological and archaeological plant specimens for taxonomic identification and analysis. This work brought Jones in contact with many of the major figures in the fields of archaeology and ethnobotany, and the analyses from the over 350 specimen reports Jones authored were cited countless times in field reports and publications (though Jones did not always receive proper attribution).

 Jones conceived of ethnobotany as much broader than simple identification and listing of plant samples, however. His ecological perspective on the field, which he defined as ""the study of the interrelationships between primitive man and plants,"" was instilled in the many students he mentored over the years and shaped its future development. Jones was particularly notable for his pioneering work in paleoethnobotany; little recognized at the time they were done, Jones' studies of the biological remains of archaeological sites received renewed attention through the ongoing research of his former students, particularly Richard Yarnell, Vorsila Bohrer, and Richard Ford. In the late 1960s, Jones work at the University also involved consulting for a series of TV productions on Native Americans done in collaboration with the University of Michigan Law School and Television Center called Silent Heritage.

 Jones' interest in Native Americans extended to his activities outside of the university as well. He served on several state commissions related to Native Americans in Michigan. He was also president of the Memorial to the American Indian Foundation, an organization formed in Ann Arbor in 1953 with an eye to erecting a sculpture in Gallup, New Mexico. Jones was also sometimes called upon to use his ethnobotanical knowledge in unusual ways, including serving as an expert witness from the 1940s to 1960s in the identification of marijuana plants for criminal cases.

 Jones was married to Joyce Hedrick, a mycologist, from 1933 until her death in 1978. They had one son, Alan, born in 1937. Jones died on December 12, 1982 in Ann Arbor.

2083,umich-bhl-8635,"James K. Pollock Papers, 1920-1968","University of Michigan professor of political science, special advisor to the U.S. Military Government in Germany after World War II, participant in numerous government commissions; papers include correspondence, working files, speeches, course materials, and visual and sound materials.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The James K. Pollock papers represent an accumulation of files from a lifetime of academic teaching and research and an extraordinary number of public service responsibilities to both his state and his nation. The files within the collection fall into two categories: types of document (such as correspondence, speeches and writings, visual materials, etc.) and files resulting from a specific activity or position (such as his work as delegate to the Michigan Constitutional Convention or his service with the Office of the Military Government in Germany after World War II).

 The collection is large and of a complicated arrangement because of Pollock's many activities. When received in 1969, the files were maintained as received; very little processing was done to the collection so that an inventory to the papers could be quickly prepared. The order of material is that devised by James K. Pollock and his secretarial staff in the U-M Department of Political Science. Recognizing the anomalies within the order of the collection, the library made the decision to list the contents to the collection while at the same time preparing a detailed card file index (by box and folder number, i.e. 16-8) to significant correspondents and subjects. While there was much to be said for this method of preparing a finding aid expeditiously, it also covered up some problems in arrangement. Thus series and subseries of materials are not always grouped together as they were created by Pollock. Files on the Hoover Commission and the Michigan Constitutional Convention, for example, come before Pollock's work in Germany after the war. In 1999, effort was made to resolve some of the inconsistencies and obvious misfilings of the first inventory but because of the numbering system used in 1969 and the card index prepared for the files, there are still some problems. Researchers should be alert to these difficulties and take time to examine different parts of the collection for material on a similar topic.","James K. Pollock was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on May 25, 1898. He began his academic association with the University of Michigan as a student from 1916 to 1921. He received his A.B. degree in 1920 followed by the M.A. in 1921. While working on his Ph.D. degree at Harvard University, 1921-1925, he taught at Geneva College in Pennsylvania and at Ohio State University. In 1925 he accepted an instructorship in political science at the University of Michigan. He was promoted to full professor in 1934, served as departmental chairman, 1947-61, and occupied the Murfin chair from 1948 until his retirement in 1968. Although involved in many non-academic activities as well, Professor Pollock always considered himself primarily a teacher. Upon his retirement as departmental chairman, he insisted upon spending his remaining years on the faculty teaching undergraduates. In recognition of his achievements, the University of Michigan gave him its Distinguished Faculty Award in 1959.

 Professor Pollock's work at the University of Michigan was only one facet of a varied career, however. His interest in political parties, campaigns, and elections, both in America and in Europe, was not just academic. Over the years, his expertise in these subjects led both the state of Michigan and the U.S. government to request his advice on various occasions.

 In 1935 Professor Pollock accepted a request to head the newly created Michigan Civil Service Study Commission, which investigated the problem of political ""spoils"" and devised methods of creating an adequate personnel agency and improving working conditions for civil servants. Michigan enacted a basic civil service law in 1937, and strengthened it in 1940 despite attacks by the beneficiaries of the spoils system. In the course of the struggle, Pollock was instrumental in helping to found the Michigan Merit System Association, designed to improve and protect civil service in Michigan. He maintained an active interest in the system throughout his life, and for his work he has been termed ""the father of Michigan's civil service.""

 However, it was Pollock's interest in foreign political systems, particularly in those of Germany, which was to dominate his career. His interest began in the 1920s, and in 1928 a grant from the Social Science Research Council financed a trip to Europe which resulted in studies of parties and elections in Great Britain, France, Ireland, and Germany. Professor Pollock's interest became increasingly focused on Germany, and as a result of his work on German elections, the Plebiscite Commission of the League of Nations chose him as the American observer at the Saar plebiscite in 1935, in which the Saarlanders voted to reunite with Germany.

 Professor Pollock's status as an expert on German affairs led the U.S. government to tap him for wartime activities. He lectured at the Provost Marshal General's School at Fort Custer in 1942-43, and participated in both the Judge Advocate General's School and the Civil Affairs Training School at Michigan from 1943 to 1945. In addition, from 1941 to 1943 Pollock gave weekly news analyses and speeches on various Detroit radio stations. Throughout the war, Professor Pollock wrote prolifically on the topic of Germany, the question of her responsibility and guilt, and the problem of how a defeated Germany was to be treated following the war. Although Pollock strongly condemned the Nazis and did not hesitate to insist that the Germans themselves were responsible for Hitler, he rejected the ideas, current among many in the U.S., that all Germans were Nazis and that Germany should be destroyed territorially after her defeat. Pollock believed that a postwar democratic state in Germany was possible, but insisted it could only be built by the Germans themselves. To this end, he offered various concrete proposals regarding the occupation of Germany, all of them involving the direct participation of non-Nazi Germans in the government at an early stage, and geared toward the most rapid reconstruction possible.

 The constructive nature of Professor Pollock's approach no doubt had much to do with the U.S. government's request in 1945 that he serve as special adviser to General Lucius D. Clay, deputy governor of the American zone in Germany. Clay faced enormous problems resulting from lack of coordination and communication between the zones, as well as from lack of local government within the American zone. Pollock's assignment was to develop a political and governmental framework for the zone. This was done by dividing the zone into four Lander or states, each with a Minister-President at its head, supported by a skeletal bureaucracy. To coordinate and supervise these state governments, the American Military Government established a Regional Government Coordinating Office (RGCO) at Stuttgart, with Pollock as its director. In addition, a German counterpart called the Landerrat or Council of States was established, consisting of the Minister-Presidents, their supporting personnel and a central secretariat. The Landerrat met regularly in Stuttgart and, with American counseling, established patterns for regional and local government, helped to recreate systems of justice and security, and made preparations for drafting constitutions for future self-government. Pollock deliberately remained in the background, encouraging the Landerrat to be as self-sufficient as possible, with the result that a much more rapid political revival occurred than in the other zones.

 Professor Pollock returned to Ann Arbor in September 1946, but went back to Germany in 1947 and 1948 on observatory missions for the Office of Military Government in Germany, United States Zone. In 1950, following the unification of the non-Soviet zones of occupation and the enactment of the Basic Law of 1949, the cornerstone of the Federal Republic, he conducted a fact-finding mission for the United States High Commissioner for Germany. Professor Pollock was formally honored by both the U.S. and German governments for his work with the Landerrat. In 1946 President Truman conferred upon him the U.S. government's highest civilian award, the Medal of Merit, and in 1956 and 1959, respectively, the German government awarded him the Grand Cross Order of Merit and the Knight Commander's Cross.

 During the postwar years, Professor Pollock was active in a number of organizations (particularly the Franz Lieber Foundation) which promoted better understanding between Germans and Americans, and which were dedicated to keeping the cause of a unified Germany in the public eye of this country. In addition, Pollock expanded his duties in the Political Science department at the university, and became involved with the American Political Science Association and the International Political Science Association, serving as president of the former in 1950 and of the latter from 1955 to 1958.

 In 1947, Pollock was appointed a member of the Committee on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, better known as the Hoover Commission, which had just been created by Congress. Its purpose was to attempt to bring the machinery of the executive branch of the federal government back within the control of the president, increasing its efficiency and its responsiveness at the same time. Pollock served on the committee until 1949, and remained concerned with these problems throughout the 1950s. The final report of the Hoover Commission made a request for a ""continuing agency"" to deal with the problems in this area, and in 1959, after several intermediate commissions, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations was created by act of Congress. Pollock served as vice-chairman of the Commission from 1959 to 1961. Professor Pollock's interest during the 1950s in the relationship between federal and state governments also led to his one attempt at elective office; he was elected as a delegate of the Republican party to the Michigan Constitutional Convention in 1961.

 Professor Pollock retired as departmental chairman in 1961, and retired from the University of Michigan in 1968. Unfortunately, his desire to pursue further such various topics such as the reform of state government, the reorganization of the federal executive and the problems of governments abroad was cut short by his death a few months later, on October 4, 1968.",7304; 9883; 9884; 5738; 5138,"Civil service.; Political science.; Reconstruction (1939-1951); World War, 1939-1945.; Civil service.",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm,3468; 3152; 3191; 3169; 3142; 3144; 3141,Cartoons.; Diaries.; Digital file formats.; Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Sound recordings.; Videotapes.,gmgpc; aat; aat; aat; aat; aat; aat,2565; 812; 2566; 1581; 2431; 2567; 2568,Germany; Michigan; Saar River Valley (France and Germany); United States; Germany; Germany; Germany (West),lcsh; local; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,2506; 6790; 7036; 5259; 5401; 6790; 5152; 1310; 2091; 483; 2614; 7036; 5225; 1778; 8870; 9031; 6152; 978; 221; 6212; 3591; 362; 2728; 734; 2346; 3412; 9042; 5629; 5770; 8652; 3805; 5607; 2034; 2568; 7775; 7421; 8470; 4188; 354; 4176; 27; 5896; 1711; 6214; 4297; 2190; 8797; 255; 8903; 7653; 2816; 4023; 437; 5392; 1451; 5533; 7515; 1008; 8255; 2322; 435; 5873; 3729; 4705; 567; 7715; 8291; 91; 6120; 8836; 1475; 7028; 3490; 5401; 4728; 3019; 3890; 2903; 6705; 4474; 6884; 513; 3817; 893; 3690; 932; 3938,"Pollock, James Kerr, 1898-; Pollock, James K.

The first is the papers of Ruthven as president of the University of Michigan, 1929 to 1951. The second, and smaller, series is the files maintained by Ruthven as a zoologist with the University Museum and as professor of zoology. This latter series dates largely from 1908 to 1929 but also includes collected earlier files from the 1870s.","Alexander G. Ruthven was born April 1, 1882 in Hull, Iowa. He received his BS degree in 1903 from Morningside College and his Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Michigan. As a zoologist, Ruthven's major interest was in reptiles and amphibians - snakes, lizards turtles, frogs, etc. He wrote extensively in his disciple and also directed various scientific expeditions in North, South and Central America. Also, before assuming the presidency, Ruthven was chief field naturalist with the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey (1908-1912).

 Ruthven's entire career was spent at the University of Michigan where he was successively instructor of zoology and curator of the Museum of Zoology (1906-1911); assistant professor and curator of the Museum of Zoology (1911-1913); assistant professor and director of the Museum of Zoology (1913-1915); profess and director of the Museum of Zoology (1915-1929); director of University Museums (1922-1936); chairman of the department of zoology and director of the Zoological Laboratories (1927-1929); and dean of administration (1928-1929). Upon President Little's resignation, Ruthven was named to a committee of three to administer the affairs of the University. With administrative skills demonstrated in this position, Ruthven in October 1929 was selected by the regents as president of the University of Michigan. He served in this position until 1951 when Harlan Hatcher assumed office.

 Upon assuming office as president, Ruthven worked to reform the administrative structure of the university. He believed that the university must distribute authority and responsibility among the many units and officers which make up the total structure. Early on he selected two vice-presidents, one in charge of business affairs and the other in charge of educational investigations. He also appointed a director of plant extension, and some time later, a vice-president in charge of university relations outside the campus. In 1944, the university's administrative structure included a provost, two vice-presidents, and a secretary. Deans and directors of schools, colleges, and other educational units were given authority commensurate with their responsibilities. Usually, advisory or executive committees were set up to aid unit heads with their duties.

 During Ruthven's tenure, the School of Music was formally affiliated and integration with the university. In 1941, the School of Public Health was established; and in 1951, the School of Social Work was established.

Blythe Stason Papers,"University of Michigan law professor and dean of the law school, member of numerous governmental and professional organizations; organizational and subject files.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The E. Blythe Stason collection documents the activities of this law school dean, foundation head, and member of numerous governmental and professional organizations. Although there are significant materials relating to his tenure as Dean of the U-M Law School, the researcher should note that the bulk of those files will be located within the record group for that university unit.","E. Blythe Stason, dean of the Law School of the University of Michigan from 1939 to 1960, was a distinguished legal educator who also served on numerous state and national professional organizations and committees.

 Born in Sioux City, Iowa in 1891, Stason graduated from the University of Wisconsin (A.B. 1913), from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (B.S. 1916), and from the University of Michigan Law School (J.D. 1922). With practical experience in both engineering and the practice of law, Stason joined the U-M Law School faculty in 1924 where he remained until his retirement on September 5, 1960. Within the University, in addition to his tenure as dean, Stason also served as Provost from 1938 to 1944.

 Outside of his University responsibilities, Stason was frequently called upon for service to various governmental agencies and professional groups. He was a member of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws; the Michigan Constitution Revision Commission; the Michigan Tax Study Commission; the Michigan Anti-Subversive Study Committee; the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure; the Hoover Commission Task Force on Legal Services and Practices of the Executive Branch; and the Fund for Peaceful Atomic Development (Administrator beginning in 1955).

 Following his retirement from the University, Stason accepted a position as administrator of the American Bar Foundation serving from 1960 to 1964. He then accepted a position at the Vanderbilt University Law School where he taught from 1964 to 1970.

The collection is organized into seven series: Autobiography/Biography, Professional and Published Correspondence, Diaries and Travelogues, Writings, Photographs, and Correspondence with family and friends (1861-1926).","Joseph Beal Steere was born February 9, 1842, in a house on Bean Creek, in the township of Rollin, Lenawee County, Michigan. His parents, William Millhouse Steere and Elizabeth Cleghorn Steere (nee Beal), were of pioneer Quaker stock. Both had brief careers as teachers before they married and turned to farming. In 1848 the Steere family moved by railroad and canal to Covington, Kentucky, on account of the father's poor health. In 1849 they moved again, to a spot twelve miles from Cincinnati.

 After the entire family recovered from a bout with typhoid the next year, the Steeres returned to Michigan by wagon. In 1851, when Joseph was nine years old, he was sent to live with his uncle, to work to earn his keep.

 In 1853 the Steeres moved to the ""Miner Settlement"" in Bloomer Center, Montcalm County. Steere recalled that school became important to him at this time. He had always enjoyed reading, but now he began to push himself to excel.

 In 1858 Dr. George Pray, one of the earliest graduates from the University of Michigan, moved to a farm not far from the Steere home. Pray made a generous offer to prepare any interested student for college. Joseph Steere took up his offer, and he began to study with Dr. Pray on a weekly basis.

 Steere was nineteen when the Civil War broke out. He wanted to enlist, but he was unable to, in part because of his father's opposition. So he remained at home and studied and taught school.

 During the Civil War Steere moved to Ann Arbor, where he lived with Dr. Pray. Believing that he needed further formal education, Steere obtained permission to attend Ann Arbor High School. While two of his brothers did ultimately fight for the Union, Steere's enthusiasm to participate was tempered by his desire to receive an education. He never did enlist.

 While in Ann Arbor, Steere became acquainted with the town's first botanist, Miss Mary Clark, who ran a girls' school. Steere had been interested in the workings of the natural world since childhood, but it is possible that his friendship with Miss Clark was instrumental in directing him toward a career in natural history.

 After Steere was graduated from high school, he worked on his father's farm until he passed the University of Michigan entrance exam. He began his college education in September, 1864. Although he had become interested in natural history, he entered the University of Michigan Law School in 1868. He earned his degree two years later.

 He did not practice law. Instead he embarked on an extensive world tour to gather collections for the University of Michigan Museum. His mother's cousin, Rice A. Beal--owner and publisher of the Ann Arbor Courier--agreed to pay for the expedition if Steere would write letters from his journey to be published in the Courier. Steere's travels lasted more than four years, taking him across the Andes (by horse and by foot) into Peru, and then east to China, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, the Malaccas, and the Dutch Moluccas.

 Steere shipped home thousands of specimens of birds, reptiles, mammals, and plants. On the Island of Marajo he excavated huge prehistoric burial mounds. He obtained rare manuscripts from Formosa, and he studied fifteen previously unknown tribes along the Amazon. He was especially interested in native dialects, and he compiled phonetic studies of several different languages.

 His work in the Philippines was particularly notable. Many of the islands he visited had never been scientifically studied. He added at least sixty species of birds to the known Philippine avifauna, and he did extensive work on the distribution of animals throughout the archipelago.

 In 1875, when Steere reached Singapore, he received word that he had received the University of Michigan's first honorary doctorate, in recognition of his scientific achievements. At the same time he was made an Assistant Professor.

 The following year the Regents appointed Steere Assistant Professor of Paleontology and Curator of the Museum to which he had donated his collection. This was the first such museum to be built on the campus of a state university, and, consequently, a large variety of contributions began to pour into the new museum, including the Chinese collection that had been exhibited at the World's Industrial Fair, 1884-1885, in New Orleans. (In April of 1876, shortly after assuming his new responsibilities at the University of Michigan, Steere had spent some time in the British Museum collecting and perfecting data for his own collections.)

 In 1879 Steere became a full Professor of Zoology and Paleontology. During that year he returned to the Amazon with a party of male university students. In the space of three months they collected over a thousand specimens of birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish.

 In 1887 Steere requested a year's leave of absence, and again leading a party of five younger men, he returned to the Philippines. Three years later he went back to the Amazon, this time under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. He studied the Hypurinas, Jamadi, and Paumari Indians.

 Steere resigned from the University in 1894. He had been asked to resign by the Regents, possibly, as he maintained, because his outspoken stance on temperance had angered the local German community.

 After retiring, Steere spent the rest of his life on his farm near Ypsilanti. In 1901, however, he was again in the Amazon region, collecting for the Smithsonian's exhibition for the International Exposition in Buffalo. He continued to take an interest in scientific trends, and he carried on correspondence with his former colleagues and with people working for Prohibition.

 Steere was an intensely religious man. He was active in the Methodist Sunday School and in the temperance movement. He sided with the Darwinists in the great nineteenth century debate over evolution versus creationism, but he was a strong proponent of what he called ""argument from design."" He believed that the natural world provided ample proof of the existence of a Designer, for he felt that life was too meticulously formed and intricately linked to be merely the result of fortuitous and random accidents.

 Steere's later writings reflect his thoughts on religion, philosophy, and evolution. He began an autobiography when he was 89 years old, a work that showed a fine memory for detail, particularly details from his childhood years. He wrote some verse and numerous moralistic children's stories--many of them with animals living in authentic woodland settings.

 Steere married Helen Buzzard on September 30, 1879. Before their marriage she had been the principal of the first ward school of Ann Arbor. The couple had five daughters and four sons.

 Steere died on December 7, 1940. He was ninety-eight years old. Accolades for his lifetime accomplishments came from, among others, the University of Michigan, from the community of natural sciences, and from the Philippine National Council.",7153; 10320; 6497; 10321; 6068; 6067; 6211; 3822; 10322,Evolution; Naturalists; Philosophy.; Scientific expeditions.; Travelers.; Voyages and travels.; Zoology.; Expeditions and surveys.; Indians of South America.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lcsh,3142; 3152,Photographs.; Diaries.,aat; aat,2847; 931; 947; 1711; 2848; 1013; 2848; 1013,Amazon River.; China; China; East Asia.; Philippines; South America.; Philippines; South America.,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,8197; 8197; 5045; 7324; 2789; 2171; 6942; 7892; 2791; 7200; 1279; 2885; 3348; 6636; 4808; 208; 4100; 3467; 1799; 6028; 5277; 3167; 8034; 4455; 178; 3837; 3509; 2538; 454; 1080; 2197; 5027; 5992; 22; 1418; 6799; 6749; 8042; 157; 5218; 798; 5371; 714; 2458; 3461; 2971; 181; 3481; 7120; 7183; 1117; 7445; 3817; 2220; 4488; 9059; 901; 4094; 627; 8320; 524; 2569; 2717; 1180; 7169; 5071; 3114; 5930; 9037; 3028,"Steere, Joseph Beal, 1842-1940; Steere, Joseph Beal, 1842-1940; Agassiz, Alexander, 1835-1910; Allen, J.

Researchers should be advised that the 1979 finding aid contains some inacuracies.","Ivan H. Walton was born in Mount Pleasant, Michigan on 10 August 1893. He received all of his early education there, including three years of undergraduate university training at Central Michigan University (1911-1913). In 1913 he left school to work as a journalist. Over the next several years he was employed on the news staffs of the Detroit <title render=""italic"">News</title>, the Toledo <title render=""italic"">Blade</title> and the Grand Rapids <title render=""italic"">Herald.</title> In 1917, when the United States entered World War I, he joined the U. S. Army Air Corps and served until shortly after the war's end, attaining the rank of second lieutenant. He then resumed his undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, and received a B. A. degree from there in 1917. A few months later he joined the faculty of Engineering as a lecturer in English. He remained with that department until his retirement forty-three years later (July 1962) with the rank of professor.

 During his early years of teaching, Mr. Walton continued his formal education at the University of Michigan, receiving his M. A. in 1921. He subsequently did further graduate work on American Folklore at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois. In 1938 he helped found the Michigan Folklore Group, which became the Michigan Folklore Society in 1940. He served as its president for two terms and thereafter was its permanent executive secretary for many years. Professor Walton died on April 14, 1968 in Tucson, Arizona where he and his wife Mildred had retired in 1963.

 Though he maintained a strong interest in American folklore generally throughout his career, from the late 1920s onward he focused his attention and scholarly efforts increasingly on the Great Lakes. He became particularly interested in the ballads, chanties (work songs) and lore which had their origins in the lives and work of sailors there during the ""schooner age""-- that period in the history of shipping on the Great Lakes which encompassed much of the 19th century, but especially the several decades between the Civil War and World War I.

 In a letter to an acquaintance written in 1939, Walton summarized his life's work to that date, also giving thought to the importance that his collection of manuscripts and sound recordings would have for future scholars.

 <blockquote><p> I am a native of Michigan, have studied at the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago, and for the last fifteen years have been teaching English at the University of Michigan here in Ann Arbor, my special field being American Literature. I have had the good fortune of being able to spend a number of my vacation periods on and about the Great Lakes and have taken advantage of this opportunity to assemble all that I could of the extant lore that is associated with these lakes. I have visited all the ports on both the American and Canadian sides and have talked to scores of old sailors, and from them I have assembled a considerable body of yarns, legends, superstitions, weather sayings, shanties, amusement songs, and other such material that grew out of commercial navigation. I have been particularly interested in sailor life and the lore that came out of it during the last half of the last century when the bulk of commerce between the lake ports was carried in sailing vessels. Life aboard these old schooners, barques, fore-'n-afters, and even sailing barges had a quality that was especially conducive to the growth of stories and songs.

 The material I have assembled, as far as I have been able to learn, is the only collection of its kind in existence. Some of it is a bit rough, as should be expected, but all of it is redolent of the devil-may-care, colorful, and often tragic life out which it grew.</p></blockquote>",17442; 17443; 17444; 3747; 3626; 4033; 3941; 16838; 13957; 15445; 15649,"Sea songs; Folk music; Folklorists; Ferries.; Lumber industry.; Shipping; Ships; Waterfronts.; Folk songs, English; Folk songs, Irish; Sea songs",lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,3142; 3489; 3142; 3144,Photographs.; Postcards.; Photographs.; Sound recordings.,aat; gmgpc; aat; aat,1349; 1154; 1552; 1209; 3093,Beaver Island (Mich.); Ludington (Mich.); Pentwater (Mich.); Port Huron (Mich.); Michigan,lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh; lcsh,910; 910; 910; 16671; 910; 3108; 16671,"Walton, Ivan.; Walton, Ivan.; Walton, Ivan.; Lomax, Alan, 1915-2002; Walton, Ivan.; Grimm, Joe.; Lomax, Alan, 1915-2002",lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf; lcnaf,,,,,,

The records of the Regents--which includes exhibits of Regents' meetings, topical files, correspondence files, audio and visual material, and archived web content--reflect this broad range of interests and authority. But while the documentation is wide-ranging, it is not continuous. Certain types of records are continually before the Regents, particularly information regarding salaries, leaves of absence, appointments to faculty positions, and formal approval of degrees conferred upon students. More often, however, the Regents are presented with a specific problem and asked to resolve it through the creation of policy. After the creation and successful implementation of a policy, the situation which caused the issue to arise is usually no longer a matter of Regental concern. The Regents' records reflect this pattern of action. Issues arise, are resolved, and then are supplanted by new concerns.

Also included in this collection are a number of documents from predecessor institutions. Of particular note is the Land Grant from the United States to the University of Michigan, 1824, which details the sections of land given to the Trustees of the University of Michigan by the power vested in Lewis Cass (as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Territory of Michigan) by section 16 of the Treaty at the Foot of the Rapids (Treaty of Fort Meigs), 1817, and section 6 of the Treaty of Detroit, 1807. By treaty, the chiefs, sachems, and warriors of four Indeginous nations, the Ottawa (Odawa), Ojibwe (Ojibwa, Chippewa), Wyandotte (Wyandot), and Potawatomi (Bodéwadmi, Potawatomie, Patawatima) ceeded the land northwest of the Ohio river to the United States of America. In the Treaty at the Foot of the Rapids, the chiefs, sachems, and warriors of the Wyandotte, Seneca (Onödowáʼga), Delaware (Lenape), Shawnee (sawanooki), Potawatomi, Ottawa and Ojibwe ceeded the rest of their lands within the Ohio territory to the United States. In return, among other promises, the Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi tribes were promised six sections of land to be reserved for the rector of St. Ann Catholic church, for religious practice; and the college of Detroit, for the future education of their children. ","The Regents of the University of Michigan trace their authority to the founding of the ""Catholepistemiad, or University, of Michigania,"" a body created by Michigan territorial law on August 26, 1817. The Catholepistemiad was to have 13 didaxiim who both served as professors and also formed the governing body of the institution. The ""didactors"" exercised complete control over the school's affairs and were granted a mandate to establish courses of instruction throughout the territory.

 In accordance with the law, acting territorial governor William Woodbridge appointed two men, the Reverends John Monteith and Gabriel Richard, didactors. While the two made a modest beginning, the Catholepistemiad proved far more ambitious a program than the territory was capable of sustaining. Recognizing this fact, a new territorial law was enacted on April 30, 1821, superseding the act of 1817.

 The law of 1821 substantially changed the structure of the university's governing body. Control of the ""University of Michigan"" was removed from the faculty and vested in a board of 21 individuals, ""The Trustees of the University of Michigan."" The territorial governor served as an ex-officio member of the Trustees, the other members were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the territorial legislature. The law of 1821, like that of 1817, envisioned an institution too large for the territory to successfully support. By 1827 the university no longer offered classes and the building erected in Detroit by the Trustees was being leased to private educational groups.
 
 In 1824, the United States of America issues a land grant to the Trustees of the University of Michigan, based on the Treaty at the Foot of the Rapids (Fort Meigs)(1817) and the Treaty at Detroit (1807) that allocated land for the College of Detroit. Until Congress abolished the practice of making treaties with Indigenous Nations in 1871, the United States signed and ratified at least 367 such treaties, many of which it later broke or failed to observe. Many of these treaties were signed by tribes under duress - cede the land or be removed from their home. Lewis Cass, territorial govenor of Michigan, was a central figure in implementing the Indian removal policies of the United States government, in addition to authorizing the Treaty at the Foot of the Rapids that allocated land given to the University of Michigan. 
 
 The state constitution of 1835 recognized implicitly the existence of a state university and granted power to regulate such an institution to the Legislature. No action was taken, however, to revive the dormant university until the passage of a new organic act by the Legislature on March 18, 1837. The law of 1837 re-established ""The University of Michigan"" and vested its governance in a body called the Board of Regents. The Regents consisted of 12 individuals chosen by the governor with the advice and consent of the state senate, to be presided over by the chancellor (senior administrative officer) of the university, who was made an ex-officio member of the Regents. Other ex-officio members included the governor, the Lt. governor, the judges of the State Supreme Court and the chancellor of the State. The authority of the Regents, in contrast to that of the State Legislature, was unclear. Specifically it was uncertain if the Regents' authority extended to the appointment of a university chancellor, new professorships or selection of branch sites, or if the Legislature's advice and consent was necessary before such actions were legal.

 As part of a general revision of Michigan statutes in 1846 the Legislature attempted to define more precisely the exact relationship between itself and the Regents. The Regents were given specifically the power to appoint the university's chancellor and other changes were also made. The result, however, was not particularly helpful in clarifying the overall scope of the Regents' authority.

 The state constitution of 1850 proved a watershed in defining the relationship between the Regents and the Legislature. The drafters of the new constitution wished to remove the Regents from the direct political pressure of the Legislature. They therefore established the Regents as a quasi-independent agency. The body was granted the authority to carry out ""the general supervision of the University...."" The Regents were to be elected to six-year terms of office, each regent being chosen from the state's judicial districts. In 1862 the latter constitutional provision was modified in that Regents were to be elected statewide, and their terms of office were to be staggered, so that two of the eight seats were filled every two years.

 While the scope of the ""general supervision"" clause was not immediately clear, a series of judicial interpretations eventually made it the basis for a broad mandate of authority, limiting the State Legislature's direct interference in university affairs. The State Supreme Court first limited the Legislature in favor of the Regents in the People v. The Regents of the University of Michigan, decided in 1856. The process of judicial interpretation was slow, however, and it was not until 1896 in the case of Sterling v. The Regents of the University of Michigan that the State Supreme Court definitively ruled that the ""general supervision"" clause of the 1850 constitution barred direct interference by the Legislature in the affairs of the university.

 The state constitution of 1908 repeated the ""general supervision"" clause of the constitution of 1850 while significantly broadening the powers of the Regents. The new document granted the Regents ""direction and control of all expenditures from the University funds."" The Regents interpreted this clause as granting them the power to dispose of state appropriations without review by state executive officials. The Regents' interpretation of the clause was sustained by the State Supreme Court in 1911 in Board of Regents of the University of Michigan v. The Auditor General. In that case the Court ruled that appropriations to the university became the ""property"" of the Regents, subject only to such conditions as the Legislature attached to the appropriations.

 The Legislature's ability to attach such conditions was limited by the Supreme Court in 1924. Ruling in State Board of Agriculture v. The Auditor General (the constitution of 1908 had granted to Michigan State College, now Michigan State University, and its governing body, the State Board of Agriculture, powers similar to that exercised by the Regents of the University of Michigan), the Court stated that the Legislature could not establish ""unconstitutional conditions"" to appropriations and that, should the Legislature feel its will violated or ignored by the Regents, its recourse was through the courts. While the decision gave the Regents considerable authority, neither in this decision nor in a number of subsequent rulings, did the State Supreme Court systematically define ""unconstitutional provisions,"" preferring to resolve issues on the merits of the particular case rather than through constitutional interpretation.

 The authority granted the Regents by the courts was subtly diminished through subsequent action of the Legislature. In 1933 the Legislature abandoned the historic practice of levying a special mill tax to support the university. Henceforth money was to come from the state's general fund. The possibility for legislative intervention was further enhanced by the decision in 1947 to modify the nature of the university's appropriation from a continuing resolution to an annual one.

 While the 1963 state constitution reconfirmed the constitutional status of the Regents as defined in 1850 and 1908, it made changes in the Regents' membership and procedures, while continuing the trend toward increased financial accountability to the Legislature. The constitution of 1963 removed the Superintendent of Public Instruction as an ex-officio member of the Regents. It mandated that all formal sessions of the Regents be opened to the public. Finally it required that an annual accounting of all income and expenditures be made to the Legislature.

 In addition to these provisions the 1963 constitution established a state Board of Education and declared it ""the general planning and coordinating body for all public education, including higher education."" The Regents argued that subsequent clauses of the 1963 constitution limited the Board from impinging upon the traditional powers of the Regents. The Board of Education challenged this interpretation of the constitution, and eventually the issue was placed before the State Supreme Court. That body resolved the issue in favor of the Regents.

The program initially served as a hub for interdisciplinary courses. In the 1970s the program and coursework expanded to include the study of women and minority groups with an emphasis on Latino Studies as well as art and media studies. The Program became a Department in 2012. Records include administrative files, directors' correspondence, committee minutes, curriculum material, topical files, and material on faculty members and their activities.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The Department of American Culture (University of Michigan) records (5 linear feet, 12.36 GB and 1 archived website) contain administrative files, curriculum information, and faculty files. It also features materials documenting the interdisciplinary connections between the department and other schools, programs, and departments at the University of Michigan. The collection includes records from two of the Department of American Culture's ethnic studies programs, the Latino/a Studies Program and the Arab and Muslim American Studies Program. ","The Program in American Culture at the University of Michigan began in 1952 through the efforts of English professor Joe Lee Davis and interested students. An early history of the program cites the reason for creation as the desire to provide students with the ""opportunity to study American life from different points of view to get at the foundations of American culture."" Before the existence of a formal American culture program, graduate and undergraduate degrees in the American culture area were administered through independent study. In 1952, the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts decreed that the discipline should be recognized as a formal department. Following that recommendation, Professor Davis was appointed as its first director and an Executive committee was created comprised of professors in other departments with American culture interests. At this time, the program depended upon the willingness of other department faculty members to participate in offering American Culture courses. Many professors who teach in the area are not solely appointed to the American Culture department, but also have joint appointments with other departments, such as English, History, or Women's Studies. The program achieved full departmental status in 2012. 

 Since the birth of the department, it’s philosophy has passed through several stages. In its early days the program revolved around the study of traditional American values and aspired to build bridges between the humanities and social sciences in order to gain a better understanding of these values. Since then however, the program has broadened its scope significantly and become a truly interdepartmental program. In the early 1970s, the program began to view itself as a facilitator for the study of all American cultures, not just the European-American culture. Taking into account America's ever-increasing diversity of national origins, races, religions, and social status, program coursework evolved to include in its curriculum the study of women, Asian American, African American, Hispanic American, Native American and other ethnic minority cultures.

 The new study of other cultures in the 1970s helped to attract new faculty and further expand the program's scope. In 1984 for example, the program developed a curricular program in Latino/a Studies to address the growing societal and student interest in the history and study of Hispanic culture in America. Students from Latino/a Studies sought out other Latin American area classes and faculty in departments such as romance languages, history, sociology, and anthropology, adding new classes and bringing new faculty members to American Culture.

 The original undergraduate curriculum consisted mainly of literature, history, and social studies courses, though students were permitted to select several courses from anthropology, economics, education, journalism, philosophy, political science, the fine arts, music, and speech. In 1970, the first core course, ""American Values,"" was created in an effort to attract concentrators, bring a more unified approach to undergraduate concentration, and provide teaching opportunities for the program's graduate students. Curriculum changes persisted throughout the 1970s. Four different undergraduate tracks were created in English, history, the social sciences, and fine arts. A comparative culture component was added to allow students to study other cultures in addition to American culture. These tracks were later expanded, and as of 1994, consisted of seven tracks: Arts and Media, British and American Studies, Minority Studies, Intellectual History and Literature, Society and Politics, Latino/a Studies, and Self-Designed.
 
	The University of Michigan Program in American Culture was renamed the Department of American Culture in 2012. In 2019, the Department of American Culture offered two majors in American Culture and Latina/o Studies. The department features four formal ethnic studies programs in Arab and Muslim American Studies, Asian/Pacific Islander Studies, Latina/o Studies, and Native American Studies. The Department of American Culture also has a strong focus on African American Studies and Digital Studies.

 Masters and Ph.D. programs originally existed in the Program in American Culture. Journalists and teachers were frequent recipients of the American Culture masters degree. However, the masters program gradually declined until in 1974, it was only ""reserved for unusual cases where it was inadvisable for students to continue into the Ph.D. program."" The Ph.D. program, on the other hand, strengthened over time especially with the demise of the masters program. The papers illustrate the growth of the doctoral program to be increasingly sensitive to the diversity of American Culture.

Medicine was the second oldest field of study there, after classics. The program was started in 1850, and at that time the course lasted only a few months.

 In a letter dated October 10, 1938, a proposal to form a Medical School collection as part of the Michigan Historical Collections was submitted to Dr. A. C. Furstenberg, Dean of the Medical School. He replied in December that the executive committee of the Medical School did indeed favor the transfer of records to the university archives. This transfer was made in early 1939.

 Among the records transferred were medical theses written by students during the years 1851-1878 (the requirement was dropped in the latter year). Those for 1851-1862 were formerly bound in compilation volumes, one or more for each year, but have been disbound, due to the deterioration of the bindings, so as to be filed in separate folders. The theses for 1863-1878 were individually bound. Most of the theses were based on lectures, medical books, and/or periodicals, but some were based on personal experience, as many of the students had practiced medicine before entering medical school, some as surgeons during the Civil War.",7297;

This day is now a national day of community service observed in over 35 states. One of the most anticipated and highly regarded IASA events is the annual charity Cultural Show.

Michigan Media was created in 1978 through the merger of the university Television Center and the university Audio-Visual Education Center. The University of Michigan Television Center (TVC), founded in 1950, produced television programs for broadcast on commercial and educational television stations. Although it never operated its own on-the-air television station, the TVC developed a unique ""network"" by distributing film and videotape of programs for broadcast by local stations across the country.

 The Audio-Visual Education Center (AVEC) was formed out of the university Extension Division's Visual Education Bureau. Originally it was primarily a film distribution unit, providing instructional films to the state's elementary and secondary schools and a variety of adult organizations. As the Visual Education Bureau's activities began to center more on serving the university campus, an autonomous Audio-Visual Education Center was created. The AVEC produced and distributed instructional films as well as promotional films for the university. It also produced films on a contract basis for non-university clients.

 Michigan Media also provided closed-circuit and other television services for the university, produced films about the university, collected archival film footage of university events, and provided consultation, maintenance and technical support services for media projects in other university units. In addition to television production, Michigan Media was responsible for the AVEC film distribution library and for increased special project film production. Michigan Media was disbanded in 1987 after a unit review and its functions were eliminated or distributed to other university units.

 The University of Michigan Television Center and, later, Michigan Media were widely recognized as pioneers in the development of educational television programming. Along with Johns Hopkins, Michigan was one of the first universities to produce educational programs. The TVC developed the concepts of the ""telecourse"" and the ""trigger film."" Over the years, Television Center and Michigan Media productions won numerous awards from professional organizations and film festivals.

 The Television Center's first facilities were located in the Speech Department offices in Angell Hall. In 1951/52 the TVC occupied rooms in South Quad and set up a temporary closed-circuit studio in an Angell Hall classroom. The TVC's first working studio was established in the former Dolph Funeral Home building at 310 Maynard Street in Ann Arbor in January 1954. The studio and offices were moved to the Argus Building on West 4th Street in Ann Arbor in 1978.

 The university's first experience with television production involved the broadcast of student dramas on WWJ-TV, Detroit on an irregularly scheduled program entitled ""On Camera."" The plays, written and acted by UM students and directed by faculty, were rehearsed on campus. Actors and sets were then taken to WWJ's studios for the live broadcast. Nine plays were televised between 1948 and 1953. Several UM faculty members had also participated in the WWJ produced series ""University of the Air.""

 In the summer of 1950 officials of WWJ proposed to UM president Alexander Ruthven and a group of faculty that the university participate in production of a series of television programs to be called ""The University of Michigan Hour."" The station guaranteed the university one hour of air time each week on Sunday afternoon and proposed to pay participating faculty members. The station attached two conditions to the offer: that some form of college credit be awarded and that a tuition fee be charged to each registered viewer.

 A special university committee considered and accepted WWJ's proposal in September 1950. Garnet Garrison was appointed to the newly created post of Director of Television. Garrison had received a master's degree in speech from UM and then worked in New York for NBC radio. He also taught radio announcing at Columbia University. In 1947 Garrison had accepted a position in the UM Department of Speech. He would be the guiding spirit of University of Michigan television for more than twenty years.

 Production of UM Television Hour programs began in 1950. The first program aired November 5, 1950. In accord with WWJ's wishes, the one hour of air time was divided into three twenty minute segments: a liberal arts program running for fourteen weeks, a practical living program to run seven weeks, and a weekly ""showcase for the university."" The term ""telecourse"" was coined to describe the programs of the first two segments. Each of the telecourses was to feature a UM faculty member and was to be aimed at an adult audience. It was decided not to offer regular university credits for the telecourses but rather to provide each registering viewer with a certificate of participation. A minimal registration fee was charged and each registrant was provided a course outline and other supplementary material.

 The third segment of Television Hour was named the ""Teletour."" It was designed to be a ""weekly invitation to the people of Michigan to visit one of the many institutions of the university."" The teletours were usually broadcast from the WWJ studios with a faculty or staff member using a variety of props and visual aids to describe some university institution or activity. Approximately once a month the WWJ remote truck came to Ann Arbor and the teletour was broadcast live from campus.

 The telecourse programs were written by the participating professors and TVC staff. Rehearsals were conducted in the TVC facilities in Angell Hall. On Sunday morning, stars, staff, and props were transported to Detroit for the live broadcast from WWJ's studio. Because the telecourses were done live without recording equipment, no film record of the original telecourses exists. Later, several telecourses were redone and recorded on kinescope film.

 Other commercial stations soon expressed an interest in broadcasting UM programs. In September 1951 stations WJIM in Lansing and WKZO in Kalamazoo began simultaneous broadcast of the live WWJ programs via a microwave relay hookup.

 Station WOOD approached the Television Center with a proposal to begin broadcasting a second series of live programs from its studio in Grand Rapids. The station offered to provide one half-hour of air time on Saturday afternoon but insisted that the series consist of original productions, not rebroadcasts of WWJ programs. WOOD wanted individual programs of general interest that were not part of a ""telecourse."" The TVC and WOOD agreed on a format and began broadcasting a series of independent programs under the title ""Understanding Our World"" in March 1952. These programs were developed and rehearsed at the UM campus and then broadcast live from WOOD studios.

 A third request for TVC programming came in 1953 from WPAG, the UHF station in Ann Arbor. The station requested two and three quarters hours of non-commercial programming each week. An arrangement was reached whereby the TVC provided studio facilities, equipment, and technical assistance and the UM Speech Department provided programming and student staff as part of its television production courses. The WPAG programming was intended to serve as an on the air laboratory for speech students interested in television production. Several series were broadcast including community and university news, interviews with local and university personalities, and programs aimed at elementary school children. Approximately 340 programs were broadcast from October 1953 to the spring of 1957 when WPAG went off the air. Only a few of these programs were recorded on film.

 The format of the UM Television Hour was modified in the fall of 1952. The telecourse portions of the TV Hour were expanded to one half-hour each. The Teletour segment was moved to a new time slot at 5:45 Saturday evening. This program, now 15 minutes long, was renamed ""Michigan Reports"" (Series H). Beginning in the fall of 1955 the name was changed again to ""Accent: Michigan Report."" It was broadcast under that name through 1961 when the program was discontinued. Throughout, the series served as a public relations program for the university, showing the public the variety of activities taking place at the University of Michigan.

 The telecourse programs were discontinued in April 1954. Declining numbers of registrants was one factor prompting the abandonment of TV programs for which certificates of participation were issued. Other universities had begun to offer television courses for full college credit under the term telecourse. Michigan did not wish to be associated with these for-credit courses and therefore stopped issuing certificates of participation and dropped the use of the designation telecourse.

 Thereafter the Television Hour consisted of two half-hour programs of general interest. The first was a series of multi-part programs of from five to thirty segments. The programs generally featured university faculty discussing and presenting material on topics such as medicine and health, national and international affairs, science, history, and other academic subjects. Some 130 different programs were broadcast between 1954 and 1980.

 The second portion of the TV hour was given over to the ""Understanding Our World"" series (Series B) originally created for station WOOD. Though there were several multi-part programs, the series generally consisted of self-contained programs. The programs often featured UM faculty but also included local, national, and even international personalities. The format of the programs included interviews, panel discussions, demonstrations, and documentaries. Over 800 individual programs were broadcast between 1954 and 1980 covering a wide variety of subjects.

 The TVC developed a unique network through which UM programs were broadcast over commercial and public stations across the country. The first UM television network was the ""live"" hook-up of stations WJIM and WKZO to carry the programs broadcast from the WWJ-TV studios. Completion of the Maynard Street facilities on the UM campus and purchase of a kinescope camera allowed the TVC to produce and record programs in its own studio. The kinescope process recorded the ""live"" television signal on 16 millimeter film. Copies of the film were made and distributed through the mail to local television stations for broadcast at a time of their choosing. A two-inch videotape recording machine was acquired in 1963, permitting distribution of TVC programs in both film and videotape formats.

 By the mid-1960s more than 120 television stations had broadcast TVC programs. Stations joined and left the network at various times but distribution of UM programs remained high until the mid-1970s. By that time the development of the public television system and declining demand for educational programming from commercial stations combined to weaken the market for TVC programming.

 The TVC was also involved in special project programming and non-broadcast film production as well as in providing media services to other campus units. Significant special projects included re-creating and recording several telecourses for the Educational Television and Radio Center (ETRC), production of programs for the Midwest Project for Airborne Television Instruction (MPATI) and the Medical Television project.

 The ETRC, a Ford Foundation sponsored center to promote development of television as an educational medium, provided funding for the TVC to re-create and record on kinescope film three of the telecourse programs and to develop several new programs. ETRC then distributed the kinescopes to educational television stations throughout the country. The TVC videotaped approximately 100 programs for MPATI, a Purdue University-based project that broadcast educational programming over a six-state area via an aircraft with on-board video broadcasting capabilities. Among TVC productions for MPATI were a 64-part series on American literary history titled ""From Franklin to Frost,"" intended for use in high schools, and an elementary Spanish course.

 The TVC cooperated with the Medical School to develop the capacity for closed-circuit broadcasting and recording of surgical and diagnostic procedures for use in Medical School courses. Similar projects were undertaken for the Law School, Zoology Department, and other university units. The TVC also produced public relations films for the university and a variety of instructional films not intended for broadcast use.

 An innovative concept developed by Michigan Media was the ""trigger film."" These were short, open-ended dramatic vignettes designed to illustrate some problem or conflict situation and to promote discussion among the viewers. Trigger films were produced on a variety of topics including teenage driving, drug abuse, aging, and dormitory living. The trigger films were recognized with an Osella award from the 1969 Venice International Film Festival.

 In 1959 the TVC began to compile what it called a ""university film archives."" The TVC filmed many university events including awards ceremonies, building groundbreakings and dedications, retirement banquets, graduations, athletic events and marching band performances, homecoming and other social activities, student protests, visits by dignitaries, and general footage of campus buildings and scenes. This archival film was intended in part to provide stock footage for television and film production, but was also a conscious effort to document the university through film.

 When the TVC was founded in 1950 it was placed under the administrative control of the director of University Relations. A Broadcasting Committee oversaw the activities of the TVC. The TVC was headed by a director of Broadcasting, a position held by Garnet R. Garrison from 1950 to 1958. In 1958 the director's responsibilities were expanded to include management of the university radio service. Hazen Schumacher was then placed in charge of television operations as associate director of Television. Schumacher became director of Broadcasting upon Garrison's retirement in 1973.

 A major reorganization of media services occurred in 1978. The Television Center was merged with the Audio-Visual Education Center to form the University of Michigan Media Resources Center, commonly referred to as Michigan Media. The AVEC developed out of the broadcasting service of the university Extension Service. It had produced filmstrips, audiotapes, and films for use both within and outside the university. Some AVEC films were made for broadcast but most were intended for use by schools, community groups, and other organizations. AVEC had also developed a large film lending library to serve the university, schools, and community organizations.

 Michigan Media provided a variety of media services for the university ranging from film production to consulting, engineering services, equipment service and repair, film and tape duplication, and classroom instruction. For a short time it was also the university computer repair service.

 In the early 1980s the original television production was scaled back considerably as the demand for educational programming was increasingly met by educational television stations and commercial production companies. Michigan Media also experienced a significant downsizing imposed during the university's fiscal crisis of the early 1980s.

 Michigan Media underwent a university review in 1986. The review panel recommended that MM be retained but that its structure and function be significantly modified. Ultimately, however, it was decided that Michigan Media should be disbanded and its functions eliminated or distributed to other units. The television studio and other media production facilities and staff were divided between the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching. The film and video library was placed under the management of the Undergraduate Library. Michigan Media formally ceased to exist on June 30, 1988.

 Some Michigan Media scripts and other paper records had been transferred to the Bentley Library between 1968 and 1978. The remainder of the Michigan Media records were transferred to the Bentley in 1988.",7966; 7967; 4216; 4941; 4055; 4942; 4461; 3574; 4943; 4889; 3761,Television broadcasting; Television in education; Education.; Educational buildings; Engineering.; Law.; Medicine.; Music; Protests; Television industry.; Universities and colleges,lcsh; lcsh; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm; lctgm,3413; 3142; 3141,Motion pictures.; Photographs.; Videotapes.,lctgm; aat; aat,,,,7180; 1777; 6087; 4939; 6461; 8705; 8990; 8987; 1222; 4188; 4758; 5825; 4297; 674; 6261; 437; 3831; 1323; 1212; 4750; 91; 283; 6581; 7252; 8053; 1873; 676; 3019; 1345; 1735; 1353; 3161; 204; 4066; 4474; 2417; 1809; 4772; 7542; 6344; 7328; 5753; 4412; 5272; 6930; 7921; 3938,"Garrison, Garnet R., 1911-; Remley, Frederick.; Schumacher, Hazen J.; Akihito, Crown Prince, son of Hirohito, Emperor of Japan, 1933-; Anderson, Judith, Dame, 1898-; Barnard, Christiaan, 1922-2001; Bernstein, Leonard, 1918-1990; Chiang, May-ling Soong, 1897-2003; Copland, Aaron, 1900-1990; Ford, Gerald R., 1913-2006; Frost, Robert, 1874-1963; Graves, Robert.; Hart, Philip A.

He received his primary and high school education in Corunna. Subsequently he attended the University of Michigan, from which he received a bachelor's degree in 1914 and a law degree in 1916.

 Millard practiced law in Flint. In addition he was active in Republican Party affairs. He chaired the Genesee County Republican Committee from 1922 until 1924, and again in 1940. From 1948 until 1950 he sat on the Republican State Central Committee.

 Millard was elected the state's attorney general in 1950, a post he held until 1954. In 1955 he went to Washington where he was appointed general counsel of the Department of the Army. In 1961 he returned to Michigan and was elected a delegate to the state constitutional convention. At the convention he chaired the Committee on Emerging Problems.

 Millard's career in law and politics was interrupted by repeated military service. During the First World War he saw action as an artillery lieutenant in France. In 1921 he helped organize the Michigan National Guard, which he remained active in until 1952. Millard also served in the armed forces during World War II.

The records date from 1890 to 1983, although there are some collected photographs dating as early as 1884. The collection has been divided into six series: Central Files, Activity/Organization Files, General Files, Photographs, Songs, and Board of Representatives.","The idea of an organization embracing all of the University of Michigan's male students was offered by Edward F. Parker in the fall of 1903. The proposal sprang from a concern that a divisiveness was growing among the students, particularly between the fraternity members and the ""independents,"" that is non-fraternity members. Parker's proposal was supported at the highest levels within the university, including the president and several deans. In February 1904 the first organizational meeting was held and the name Michigan Union was chosen. In June, 1904 articles of association were signed, establishing the Michigan Union as an organization embracing all male students, alumni, faculty and regents. Although considered a part of the university family, the Michigan Union was legally a separate entity responsible only to its own Board of Directors.

 Almost immediately fund raising began for the construction of a building. Because of competing university projects early fund raising efforts were not particularly successful, but in 1907 sufficient funds had been obtained to purchase the home of Thomas M. Cooley on State Street to serve as headquarters for the organization. The Cooley home was seen as a temporary location, and plans for a new building, as well as fund raising efforts, continued. In 1908, as a part of this ongoing fund raising, the Union instituted one of its longest traditions, the Michigan Union Opera. The all-male opera toured in the fall, and occasionally the spring, visiting cities with strong alumni clubs.

 Years of fund raising were rewarded in 1916 when construction began on the Cooley site of a new Union Building. Sufficient funds existed, however, only to erect the outer shell of the structure. The first interior work was performed with funds loaned by the Michigan State War Preparedness Board, which wished to use the building as a barracks for soldiers of the Students Army Training Corps (SATC) who were sent to Ann Arbor for training. In 1918 more money was borrowed, and although several key components of the structure were still left unfinished due to a lack of funds, the building was opened for the use of members in the fall of 1919.

 The continuing financial problems of the Union led its governing board to seek the aid of the Regents. While membership in the Union was open to all male students, membership, and the payment of dues, was voluntary. In academic year 1918-1919 the Regents made the payment of Union dues a part of the registration fees paid automatically by enrolled students. This assistance in funding the union occurred at a time when the Union was reordering its financial operations to reflect the large, multifaceted building it now operated. In 1917 a separate Board of Governors was authorized by the Board of Directors to oversee the Union's financial operation. This body did not actually begin to operate until 1920, and in 1928 it was abolished and replaced by a Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

 The Union's basic functions continued undisturbed throughout the 1930s, although the building itself was expanded with additions constructed in 1936 and 1938. The influx of students after World War II strained the physical capacities, but more important were a series of social changes that challenged the Union's status as an all male club. Barriers to the participation of women in Union events were slowly, and sometimes painfully, dropped. In 1956 unescorted women were first allowed into the union. In the same year the all male Union Opera allowed women to participate in its production, changing its name to MUSKET--Michigan Union Show, Ko-Eds Too. Barriers continued to fall throughout the 1960s until the last vestige of the Union's exclusively male character, a clause barring women from life membership in the Union, was dropped in 1972.

The Museum is one of the major research facilities in the United States for the collection and study of archaeological and ethnological materials. The record group includes budget information, executive committee meeting minutes, topical files, and curator files.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The Museum of Anthropological Archaeology record group includes budget information, executive committee meeting minutes, topical files, and curator files. The records are organized in three series, Budget, Topical Files, and Curator Files.","Although anthropological specimens had been part of the University Museums' collections since the mid-1800s, it was not until much later that a discipline-specific museum was created for their research and preservation. Prior to the Museum of Anthropology's establishment in 1922, the earliest archaeological acquisitions came to the University Museum from the Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific from 1838 to 1842. Other significant collections were acquired by Joseph Beal Steere during his many trips to the Amazon, the Andes, the south Pacific and Southeast Asia in the 1870s through the 1890s. His expeditions to the Philippines began a long and continuing tradition of research in that area. Steere was also in charge of the university's natural history collections from 1876 to 1894.

 In 1922, Dean C. Worcester, one-time curator of the zoological museum at the university, returned to Ann Arbor from the Philippines to obtain support for an archaeological expedition to investigate Philippine cave sites with Chinese porcelains. Professors Francis Kelsey and Alexander G. Ruthven lent their support and requested that Carl Eugen Guthe lead the expedition with funds contributed anonymously by Horace H. Rackham. Guthe agreed to lead the party, but only if a separate Museum of Anthropology were established to house the material collected.

 Guthe's request was granted; in 1922 the University Museums were reorganized and the Museum of Anthropology was formally recognized. Carl Guthe was made the Associate Director of Anthropology in the University Museum. The collection of porcelains Guthe obtained during the three years of the Philippines expedition became the museum's most valuable single collection. Wilbert Hinsdale, formerly dean of the School of Homeopathy, was made custodian in charge of the Collections in Michigan Archaeology. Guthe's collections were housed in the basement of Angell Hall from 1925 to 1927, while Hinsdale's were located in the Museum Building.

 In 1928, the Museum of Anthropology moved into the fourth floor of the just completed University Museums Building. The museum consisted of five rooms for collections, seven rooms for offices, a library, and an office. In 1929, Guthe was promoted to director of the museum. One of Guthe's many acts as director was to offer a doctoral fellowship in Aboriginal North American Ceramics to James B. Griffin. Griffin began the fellowship in 1933, completed his degree in 1936, then joined the museum staff. In late 1943 Guthe resigned as director of the museum and recommended that Griffin be appointed as his successor. Administrative conflicts stalled the appointment for several years, but Griffin was finally approved by the Regents as the museum's director in 1946. He held this position until his retirement in 1975.

 Upon its establishment, the museum had been arranged into five collection-oriented divisions (also referred to as ranges): the Division of the Great Lakes, the Division of the Orient, the Division of Archaeology, the Division of Ethnology, and the Division of Physical Anthropology. The Division of the Great Lakes dealt with the anthropological resources of the state of Michigan and the areas of other states and Canada that border on the Great Lakes. After Hinsdale died in 1944, Emerson F. Greenman took charge of the Great Lakes Division until 1966.

 The Division of the Orient was devoted to collections from Asia and the Far East. Benjamin March was the division's first curator, followed by Kamer Aga-Oglu. The Division of Archaeology was established for the study of archaeological collections around the world, with particular focus on North America. The Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States, a central sherd repository for prehistoric ceramic materials from the region east of the Rocky Mountains and north of the Gulf of Mexico, was founded within this division in 1927. James Griffin served as curator of the division until he became director, and was succeeded by Albert Spaulding.

 The Division of Ethnology was established to house ethnological specimens from around the world, with particular focus on North America. Its first curator was Melvin Gilmore, followed by Volney Jones. The Ethnobotanical Laboratory, a center for the identification and interpretation of plant materials utilized by Native Americans, was established within this division in 1938. The Division of Physical Anthropology was originally not provided with a curator and was essentially inactive until 1966, when C. Loring Brace was appointed as curator. From that point on, the division focused primarily on prehistoric skeletal collections from North America.

 The Museum of Anthropology achieved substantial growth during Griffin's long tenure as director. The staff grew from four professional curators to nine, along with additional research associates and assistants. The museum partnered with the Department of Physics in the administration of the Radiocarbon Laboratory from 1949 to 1970; the lab was the second of its kind in the United States. Field programs were greatly expanded, with significant work done in Michigan, the Mississippi Valley, the Southwest, Western and Eastern Europe, and Israel. The museum also took an active role in the university's Department of Anthropology; the museum served as a training ground for most graduate students in archaeology and all curators held academic year appointments in the department, teaching courses and advising numerous doctoral students. Griffin served as chair of the department from 1972 to 1975.

 After Griffin's retirement, Richard I. Ford, Curator of Ethnology, was appointed as director, serving until 1981. From that period to the present, the museum's directorship has rotated among the curators of the museum, who generally serve three- or five-year terms.

In February 2014, the Museum was renamed the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.

The geographic focus of the collections has expanded, with additional curatorial positions provided for materials from Europe, Africa and Mesopotamia. The current ranges include Great Lakes Archaeology, North American Archaeology, Asian Archaeology, Ethnology, Physical Anthropology, New World High Civilizations and Old World High Civilizations. The museum currently has twelve curators, in addition to other professional and support staff.

 Today, the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology is one of the major research facilities in the United States for the collection and study of archaeological and ethnological materials.

In 1983 it was formalized as a program within the Program in American Culture. Records include material relating to the establishment and growth of the Native American Studies Program. Collection contains records relating to the Committee on Native American Studies, focusing particularly on the early planning and implementation of the Native American Studies Program and course information, documentation of campus cultural activities, and issues of the <title render=""italic"">Native American Advocate</title>.",The finding aid is written in English,"The records largely document the inception and early years of the University of Michigan's Native American Studies Program, beginning in 1972, as well as cultural and financial material from more recent years. The collection is arranged in a single series, Topical Files.

 Two folders contain extensive information regarding the Ojibwa language courses, which have been offered regularly since 1973. The majority of documents relate to the growth of the program, specifically the expansion of Native American course offerings, the hiring of Native American faculty members, the dialogue between Native American students and the University over demands for a cultural center, and increased support services on campus for Native American Students.

 The collection also consists of various budget and financial documents, as well as grant proposals. Several issues of a student publication, the <title render=""italic"">Native American Advocate</title> from 1972-1973, are included, in addition to non-University publications relating to Native American issues.","The University of Michigan's Native American Studies Program was conceived in the early seventies, following several years of lobbying on the part of the University's Native Americans students, as well as local Native Americans. Anthony L. Genia, was hired in 1972 as a Native American recruiter in the admissions office, and was primarily concerned with establishing a Native American program at the University. The University of Michigan Native American Student Association (UM-NASA) was established around the same time, holding its first organizational meeting on November 13, 1972. A Native American Advocate, Charles ""Moose"" Pamp, was hired by the UM Office of Special Services. He was to serve as ""an aggressive exponent for Native American concerns throughout the campus and community,"" and would ""open up new channels of communication...and actively represent Native American interests."" (<title render=""italic"">Native American Advocate</title>, November 1972)

 It was not until 1983 that the Native American Studies Program was officially established within the Program in American Culture. Since its inception, the Native American Studies Program at the University of Michigan has implemented several courses each year, including those in Ojibwe language instruction. There are several Native American student groups operating at the University as well, including American Indians at the University of Michigan, The Circle, the American Indian Science Engineering Society, the Native American Law Students Association, and the Native Caucus. These groups actively sponsor speakers and other events, and have put on an annual April Dance for Mother Earth Pow Wow in conjunction with the local Native community since 1972.",9597; 7386,Indians of North America; Minorities,lcsh; lcsh,,,,,,,,,,2114; 5715; 2114,University of Michigan.

Records include administrative files; materials relating to various programs and activities; and topical files. The topical files include extensive information on the yearly Hispanic Heritage Celebrations.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The records of the Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs consist of files on the administration of MESA, student, university, and community organizations, various programming, events, and activities, and topics such as student information relating to the Hispanic representative. The Hispanic Heritage Celebration is well documented in these records, as well as student organization grant applications, and the Growing Allies retreat. 

Materials include correspondence, flyers, brochures, and other promotional materials, grant applications, meeting agendas, memos, minutes, PowerPoints and other presentation materials, photographs, and video.","The 1970 Black Action Movement (BAM) at the University of Michigan (U-M) sparked a legacy of student activism at U-M that challenged the University’s lack of diversity, and its failure to support Black students and other students of color. As a result, U-M began to address concerns around admissions, space, and support. Shortly after the Trotter House was established in 1971, the Office of Special Services and Programs began. This unit had staff advocates that served a variety of ethnic constituencies, and the office acted as a central area for communities of color at U-M.

In 1977, the name changed to the Office of Minority Student Services (MSS) in order to meet the academic and social needs of students from historically underrepresented and marginalized ethnic and racial groups. MSS added to its campus programming by establishing a new division to support the diverse student population. The Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs (MESA) was set up in 1983, as a campus and community environment for minority and multi-ethnic students to succeed. It aims to support students through a variety of academic, social, economic and personal counseling services, as well as coordinating student cultural and multi-cultural organizations and programs.

As a unit of Student Affairs, MESA functions as a non-elected representative organization for minority students for U-M programs. These representatives were hired for their experience in working with students of diverse cultures and backgrounds. The staff included but were not limited to: Asian American, Native American, African American, Indian, and Hispanic/Latino/a. In 2014, MESA became an individual unit working collaboratively with Trotter House to support students. 

 The first Hispanic representative, Rosa Lopez, served from 1983 to 1988. Lopez was succeeded by Katalin Berdy from 1988 to 1997. The Hispanic representative was responsible for sponsoring student organizations, programs and activities within the university. For the organizations, the Hispanic/Latino/a representative served as a staff advisor, working with the students and helping them reach their social and academic goals. The student initiated organizations were comprised of both academically and socially motivated programs. Some of these organizations included the Socially Active Latino Students Association, (S.A.L.S.A.), the Hispanic Business Students Organization, the Council of Hispanics for Higher Education, Alianza, Puerto Rican Association, Sigma Lambda Beta Fraternity, Inc., Sigma Lambda Gamma Sorority, Inc., and the Latino/a Network. The Latino/a Network (L Net) served as an elected body for all the other Hispanic/Latino/a groups on campus. As a governing board, L Net contained two representatives, either voted for or appointed, from all the other organizations and made decisions on planning what university activities, especially the Hispanic Heritage Celebration, would occur.

 The Hispanic/Latino/a representative also acted as a liaison to the larger, Michigan minority business and government community, and social action organizations. This included involvement with the United Farm Workers Support Group, New Detroit, Inc., and LA SED, Inc., (Latin Americans for Social and Economic Development). These community organizations helped students protest the serving of California grapes in university dining halls (because of poor working conditions and treatment of the United Farm Workers and other minority farm workers who pick the grapes), motivate campus leaders into action, and provide opportunities and work experience for student volunteers within their organizations. Many local governments, businesses, and organizations aided in support for the annual Hispanic Heritage Celebration, which originated as a national festival in the early 1980's.

 In 1981, the Professional Improvement Program (PIP) was launched in collaboration with Dr. Harold Fowler and Deborah Orr May of the Office Career Planning and Placement and Eunice Royster, former director of academic services and Comprehensive Studies Program. Funded by Dow Chemical Company and Xerox Corporation, this program was designed for minority students interested in pursuing careers in business and industry.

 PIP served two primary purposes. Program leaders hoped to create student ambassadors to guide and provide membership for incoming and transfer students. They also envisioned the program to aid in matriculation success of minority students through varied workshops and experiential opportunities offered through major corporations, civic and governmental agencies, and campus professionals.

During its brief history, many noteworthy individuals visited the program to share their wisdom including tennis legend Arthur Ashe and Thomas Moore, head of the Sterling Automotive Group Foundation. The program ceased operation in the late 1980s.

Linh Nguyen was the intercultural program development program manager for MESA from 2008 to approximately 2015, when she was appointed associate director. She held the associate director position until 2018. Krishna Han replaced Nguyen as associate director after serving as assistant director from 2012-2018. Nguyen also acted as interim director before the appointment of Nadia Bazzy as MESA director in 2017. 

As of 2021, MESA aims to build intercultural and leadership skills and empower students to address social justice issues. They do this by focusing on student education and training, coordinating campus-wide events, programming, and initiatives, and partnering with student organizations, among other activities. Of note is MESA's Grants Program, which provides funding for student organization events that promote social justice education through the lens of race/ethnicity. MESA also supports the celebration of heritage months at U-M, including Arab Heritage Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Black History Month, Latinx Heritage Month, and Native American Heritage Month.",9695; 5896; 5669; 11740; 11004; 11096,Hispanic American college students; Minority college students; Social justice.; Student organizations; University of Michigan; Photographs.,lcsh; lcsh; local; lctgm; lcsh; lcsh,3191; 3208,Digital file formats.; Video recordings.,aat; aat,,,,26345,"Nguyen, Linh.",local,1702; 4893; 1702; 4310,University of Michigan.

 The arrangement of the papers maintains their original order of four series including Correspondence, Family History, Personal and Professional Papers, and Visual Materials. These are in alphabetical order except for the Personal and Professional Papers series, which follows its original chronological organization according to Paul Showers's career. The papers contain very little information about his work as a children's non-fiction author. This portion of his papers are within the Kerlan Collection, which is part of the Children's Literature Research Collections at the University of Minnesota.","Paul Showers was born on April 12, 1910 in Sunnyside, Washington. His parents returned to their home in Michigan a few years after his birth. His parents studied music at Michigan Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) and returned to continue their careers: Frank Showers was a music teacher and choir director while M. Ethelyne Showers was a concert vocalist.

 After graduating high school, Paul attended the University of Michigan to study English and theater. He became involved with many campus activities including university theater productions and Michigamua. Paul also joined the staff of the <title render=""italic"">Michigan Daily</title> and the <title render=""italic"">Gargoyle</title>, becoming an editor for both. He also formed life-long friendships with fellow writers from these publications.

 Graduation in 1931 led to small theater roles throughout Michigan. His unsteady income was supplemented by freelance writing. In particular, he became the crossword puzzle creator for <title render=""italic"">Life</title>. At the time, <title render=""italic"">Life</title> was a prominent humor magazine and Paul designed extra large, witty puzzles full of puns and word plays. His time with <title render=""italic"">Life</title> ended when <title render=""italic"">Time</title> purchased the magazine and altered its focus.

 Paul's career as a copy editor ""newspaper man"" began in 1937 when he became a member of <title render=""italic"">The Detroit News</title>'s copy staff. After a few years, he relocated to New York City to work with the <title render=""italic"">New York Herald-Tribune</title>. His time with the newspaper was cut short when he entered the U.S. Army in 1942. While in the military, he began working for the Army's publication for soldiers, <title render=""italic"">Yank Magazine</title>. His involvement took him to Japan near the end of the war to work for the Okinawa branch of Yank. Diaries and recollections from this time describe his reactions to Japanese culture and post-war devastation of Japan.

 The end of the war brought Paul back to New York City where he began his career as a copy editor with the <title render=""italic"">New York Times</title> Sunday Department. He took on additional roles during his time with the paper including Travel Editor (1949-1961), editor of the <title render=""italic"">Sunday Magazine</title> (1961-1976), and writer of book reviews and ""Times Talk"" columns. Paul turned in his <title render=""italic"">New York Times</title> resignation on July 4, 1976, declaring his own independence from the newspaper life.

 Paul Showers was fascinated by children's process of learning reading skills. His curiosity led him to write Find Out by Touching in 1961. The book engaged children through scientific questioning and activities that were applied to their everyday life. The success of the book led him to author over twenty additional children's titles for the science series ""Let's Read and Find Out."" Paul Showers's clear, straightforward, and often humorous text paired with vivid illustrations combined to create award-winning books. The Bentley Historical Library holds little manuscript material regarding his activities as a children's author. However, his books, research materials, notes, publisher correspondence, production processes, and children's fan mail are located within the Kerlan Collection of the Children's Literature Research Collections at the University of Minnesota.

 Paul Showers studied his family and ancestors throughout his life. His research, correspondence, and recollections reveal his desire to learn about the roots of his family's conservative actions and beliefs. Paul rebelled against these constraints: <blockquote><p>I have spent my life trying to free myself from the straightjacket of my childhood and adolescence. All other objectives have been secondary. But a life is not a solitary entity. It is only one segment of a continuity of genes with its inheritance of opinions and attitudes, ambitions and illusions that passes down from one generation to the next. (Paul Showers Papers, Box 1, Personal and Professional Papers - Biographical Material - Chronology and Memories)</p></blockquote>

 His introspective struggles are evident within his journals and correspondence. Descriptions vary between poetic entries and frank recollections.

The records are divided into five series: Chronological Tribe Files, Meeting Minutes, Topical Files, Visual Materials, and Printed Materials.","The Order of Angell, formerly known as Michigamua, is one of the best-known senior honor societies for men at the University of Michigan and is dedicated to bringing together outstanding upperclassmen to foster a loyalty to the university and to promote good class fellowship (Box 3, Folder: Topical Files, History and Traditions, General; Document: ""The Great Charter of the Tribe of Michigamua""). The Order of Angell was created as Michigamua in Spring 1901 by a group of students belonging to the Class of 1902. These students, all of whom attended the Literary College (now the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts) and met nightly to study together, had formed The Hot Air Club in Fall 1900. This club was expanded to include students from other units in Spring 1901 and, after much research into Native American lore, the name of the club was changed to Michigamua. Selection for membership was based upon loyalty to the university and to their class, as well as prominence in an activity that brought credit to both (William F. Temple, <title render=""italic"">The Founding of Michigamua</title>, p. 16). Members often held positions of note in student government or on student publications, or excelled in athletics or scholastic endeavors. With the Tribe of 1903, it was decided to limit the number of active members, or ""Fighting Braves,"" to no more than twenty-five men.

 A student is invited to join the organization in the winter term of his junior year by means of a tradition of ""tapping"" which occurs late at night. The student then undergoes the rites of initiation on ""Rope Day."" All members are assigned a nickname, such as Babbling Brook, intended to reflect a characteristic, trait, or activity of a brave. The active tribe meets on a regular basis in the ""Wigwam,"" located in a tower of the Michigan Union. Alumni are referred to as ""Old Braves"" and remained active by means of the Old Braves Council which advises the active tribe on various matters. Occasionally a prominent member of the faculty or administration may be invited to join the organization as an honorary member or ""Honorary Sachem.""
 
 The organization stopped using Native American practices in 1989. In 2007 the organization officially changed its name to the Order of Angell. Also in 2007, the organization announced that it will register as an official University of Michigan student group and will institute the policy of releasing the names of its members in the future.

 During the early years of the University of Michigan, the office of the president was a relatively informal post: faculty members took one year turns as president. In 1850, however, a new constitution was enacted by the state legislature in response to a widely perceived need for a stronger administrative policy at the university. The Constitution of 1850 provided that university regents be elected rather than appointed by the governor, and that a formal Office of the President should be created. The first elected regents appointed a presidential search committee in 1852, and this committee chose Henry Tappan to be the first president of the University of Michigan.

  <emph render=""bold"">Robben Fleming</emph>

 Robben Fleming, the University of Michigan's ninth president, was born on December 18, 1916 in Paw Paw, Illinois. He received his baccalaureate degree from Beloit College in 1938 and his law degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1941. He specialized in labor law and industrial relations, and went on to become a noted arbitrator. After graduating from law school, he served for six years with government agencies and the United States Army. Thereafter he returned to the University of Wisconsin and served as director of the Industrial Relations Center. He left Madison in 1952 to head the University of Illinois' Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations. In 1958 he joined the Illinois law faculty and remained until he was named chancellor of the University of Wisconsin in 1964. Three years later he was chosen as president of the University of Michigan and served in that capacity for eleven years. From 1979 to 1981 he was president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He then returned to Ann Arbor and taught one course each year in the Law School until he became Professor Emeritus in 1985. After Harold Shapiro stepped down as president of the university in 1988, Fleming served as interim president for eight months. Fleming married his wife, Sally, in 1942 (see note, page viii). There are three Fleming children: Nancy Jo, James Edmund, and Carolyn Elizabeth.

  <emph render=""bold"">Fleming Administration (1968-1978 and 1988)</emph>

 Fleming's administration was marked by the same student turbulence that swept other university campuses around the country in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Sit-ins, protests, and demonstrations at the university were particularly frequent and impassioned from Fall 1968 to early Spring 1970. They included massive demonstrations in June 1969, which originally began as a celebration of spring by exuberant students and evolved into violent protests against methods used by police to disperse the revelers; demonstrations against ROTC recruiting in March and September 1969; a sit-in in support of a university bookstore in September 1969; a teach-in against the Vietnam war in September 1969; a teach-in on the environment in March 1970; and a boycott of classes in support of increased enrollment of minority students, organized by the Black Action Movement (BAM I) in March 1970. In addition to responding to the demands of the students, Fleming had to determine when the right to dissent interfered with the enforcement of civil law, when to take disciplinary action against student dissenters, and when to involve civil authorities in controlling student unrest. Although he was criticized by some conservatives as being too ""soft"" on student protesters, and by some students as being too hard on them, it was recognized that Fleming's openness, availability, and willingness to discuss issues helped minimize tensions between administration, faculty, and students.

 If student unrest was the most difficult problem faced by Fleming in the early years of his tenure, financial problems became the most pressing issues with which he dealt thereafter. For several reasons, including inflation, negative reactions to student unrest, building cost increases, and competition for the tax dollar from human services programs, financial support for higher education from the federal and state government declined. In 1978, Michigan dropped to 33rd place among all states in monetary support for higher education (expenditures per $1000 of personal income), thus increasing the burden on students in the form of higher tuition. The university's tuition charges became the highest of any public university in the country; at the end of Fleming's tenure, student fees produced 33 percent of general fund revenues as compared to ten years earlier when they produced 25 percent and twenty years earlier when they produced 19 percent. Funding for equipment and building maintenance was reduced as well as that for purchases of library books. When the fiscal problems became more severe, budget reductions of academic units were imposed. Although in theory these were to be across the board reductions, in fact those units most favored escaped the reductions. This began a policy of selective redistribution of funds which was to continue into the next decade. The financial crisis continued into the 1980s and occupied much of the time and energy of President Harold Shapiro.

 Just as economic conditions at the national level affected university life, so too did federal government initiatives requiring the implementation of affirmative action programs. The Fleming administration was the first to have to establish policies and procedures to try to ensure that women and minorities were treated fairly throughout the university system. Among the important steps taken: the first affirmative action program was developed in 1969; commissions for women and minorities were established in the early 1970s to develop procedures, policies and practices to achieve affirmative action goals; the classification and salaries of all professional and administrative staff members were restructured in 1972 to redress inequities; employment practices aimed at finding more minority applicants were inaugurated; women's intercollegiate athletics began a slow expansion; and the Center for African and Afro-American Studies was established.

 Several significant changes occurred in undergraduate and graduate education under Fleming. The Residential College, a small and more personalized educational program, was established as an alternative to the traditional undergraduate curriculum. University branches in Dearborn and Flint became four-year colleges. The Department of Library Science became an independent school, and the School of Art became independent of the College of Architecture and Design.

 Labor relations changed greatly during Fleming's tenure. Prior to his arrival in Ann Arbor, there were only two small local unions established on campus. During the Fleming years, hospital employees were organized by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; nurses formed a union; medical interns and residents were organized; clerical employees established a union, which was later decertified; and teaching assistants organized the Graduate Employees Organization.

 Although a variety of matters occupied Robben Fleming as president of the University of Michigan, many observers believe his most important contribution came in successfully steering the university through the difficult years of student unrest. When he announced his retirement on September 15, 1978, students, faculty, and administrators alike, first and foremost, praised his calm leadership and efforts to preserve both intellectual freedom and academic discipline during that period.

  <emph render=""bold"">Harold Shapiro</emph>

 Until he resigned as the university's tenth president in 1987, Harold Shapiro had spent his entire professional academic career at the University of Michigan. He was born on June 8, 1935, in Montreal, Canada. He received his bachelor's degree in 1956 from McGill University and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in economics (the latter in 1964) from Princeton University. He immediately joined the economics faculty at Michigan as assistant professor. Three years later, in 1967, he became associate professor and was named co-director of the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, which produces the Michigan Econometric Models used in forecasting. He was promoted to professor in 1970 and during the next seven years served the university in a variety of capacities, including member and chairman of the important University Budget Priorities Committee; chairman of the Department of Economics; and member of the executive committees of the Institute for Social Research, Institute for Public Policy Studies, Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, and College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. In 1977, he became vice president for academic affairs and chairman of the Budget Administration Committee. Ten months after Robben Fleming announced his resignation as university president, the Board of Regents selected Shapiro as his replacement. Shapiro served as president for eight years, then announced on April 28, 1987, that he was leaving to become president of Princeton University. Shapiro married his wife, Vivian, shortly after leaving McGill University. While in Ann Arbor, Mrs. Shapiro was an associate professor in the School of Social Work and a lecturer in psychiatry in the Medical School. Her specialty was clinical research and training in infant mental health. The Shapiros have four daughters: Anne, Marilyn, Janet, and Karen.

  <emph render=""bold"">Shapiro Administration (1980-1987)</emph>

 Harold Shapiro assumed the presidency of the university during one of the worst fiscal crises in Michigan's history. The crisis was caused, in large part, by a deep recession in the automobile industry. For three years, in the early 1980s, the state could not meet its financial commitments to the university. In 1980/81, for example, state support for the general fund fell by 12 percent. In response, Shapiro undertook three initiatives. First, he worked to convince the state legislature of the university's significant value as a research tool for the state. The economics department, for example, undertook a study of state government financing, which proved to be very useful to legislators; and Shapiro convinced the legislature to provide funding, through the university, for the Industrial Technology Institute, a unit which drew on the expertise of university personnel to study and promote economic diversification in Michigan. Shapiro also secured funding for construction of the University Hospitals, the largest state-funded construction project in Michigan history, by explaining to the legislature that the hospitals would contribute to the state's economy.

 In his second initiative, Shapiro sought to increase private financial support for the university. This was the origin of the very successful $160 million capital campaign, Campaign For Michigan, co-chaired by former United States president Gerald Ford and General Motors chairman Roger Smith. It was the largest development effort ever completed by a public university. To direct the new push for more private support, the president lured Jon Cosovich away from Stanford University to become Michigan's vice president for development and university relations.

 The third initiative, and the most controversial one, involved implementing budget reductions and reviews of academic units perceived to be weak in order to maintain and, in some cases, improve the quality of the rest. By doing so, Shapiro believed that the university would become smaller but better. As the financial situation worsened in late 1981, a group of university executive officers, led by Shapiro and Vice President for Academic Affairs Billy Frye, drew up what became known as the Five Year Plan. The $20 million reallocation plan was announced in March 1982 and included reviews of the schools of art, education, and natural resources. Over the course of the next several years, the Department of Geography was eliminated; the Extension Service, Michigan Media, and the Institute for Labor and Industrial Relations were markedly cut back; and public reviews of the three schools were held and deep budget cuts instituted at each. Despite the fact that the faculty had voted as early as 1980 to consider a policy of selective reallocation of funds, the number of reviews, and the secrecy involved in choosing the weaker units, led to friction between administrators, particularly Billy Frye, and faculty members. Near the end of the process, Shapiro and Frye argued that there had really been no other choice for the university, but also noted that they had underestimated the emotional strain the process had placed on faculty and students. By the middle of the 1980s, much of the rancor had subsided and budget reviews had become normal occurrences, even in sound fiscal years.

 Another difficult issue faced by Shapiro concerned minority enrollment. After the BAM I strike in 1970, the university pledged to secure 10 percent Black enrollment. Despite efforts to achieve better results, the figure stood at 5.5 percent when Shapiro took office and 5.4 percent when he left. The percent of Black tenured and tenure-track faculty members remained unchanged during his presidency. In response to racist incidents on campus, and unhappiness with the progress made in increasing minority enrollment, students demonstrated in the Spring 1987 (BAM III). As a result, the university announced that new funds would be provided to secure more minority students and faculty members, grievance procedures were established, and a vice provost for minority affairs was appointed.

 At the commencement exercises in December 1987, the university's board of regents awarded Shapiro an honorary degree. In addition to complimenting him on his leadership of the university during a time of fiscal crisis, and on the massive amount of building and renovation which took place during his presidency, the board cited Shapiro's efforts to strengthen the sciences, improve the faculty, and promote interdisciplinary research.

  <emph render=""bold"">James Duderstadt</emph>

 James Duderstadt was born on December 5, 1942, in Iowa and grew up in Carollton, Missouri, a rural, German, farming community. He earned his bachelor of engineering degree from Yale University (1964) and his M.S. (1965) and Ph.D. (1967) from the California Institute of Technology. He joined the University of Michigan in 1969 as an assistant professor of nuclear engineering and became associate professor in 1972 and professor in 1976. Duderstadt's nuclear engineering interests included nuclear power-controlled thermonuclear fusion, high-powered lasers, and supercomputers. In 1981 he was named dean of the College of Engineering and during the next five years, he oversaw the move of the college to the North Campus and the establishment of several new research centers and institutes. He was designated provost and vice president for academic affairs in 1986, and two years later, on June 10, 1988, the Board of Regents named him the eleventh president of the university. He married his wife, Anne, in 1964. They have two daughters: Susan and Kathy.

  <emph render=""bold"">Duderstadt Administration (1988-1996)</emph>

 When James J. Duderstadt took over as president of the University of Michigan in September 1988, he had ambitious plans to make the university a more culturally diverse, technologically advanced and financially secure institution. To a large extent, Duderstadt was successful in achieving these goals, although his eight year tenure as president was not without controversy.

 One of Duderstadt's first actions as president was to introduce the Michigan Mandate, which was a plan to increase minority representation among faculty, staff and students at the university. The Michigan Mandate encouraged the recruiting and retention of minority students and faculty, and was also part of an effort to make the university a more welcoming, comfortable environment for members of minority groups. Minority representation among students increased from 15.4% in 1988 to 24.2% in 1994.

 Another initiative which encouraged diversity on campus was an amendment to Regents' Bylaw 14.06, which prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation at the university. Duderstadt supported the amendment in spite of vehement opposition from some members of the university community and from elsewhere in the state.

 Toward the end of his presidency, in April 1994, Duderstadt introduced an Agenda for Women, which was similar to the Michigan Mandate and was intended to improve the climate on campus for women. The goals of the agenda were broad, from increasing the numbers of women faculty and staff, to preventing sexual harassment and violence against women, to encouraging women's participation in non-traditional fields like science and engineering. While Duderstadt's efforts to promote diversity were often the source of controversy within the university community, a Michigan Daily editorial published the day after his resignation summed up his influence on these issues in a positive light: ""There is still a long way to go, but [his] vision has been an essential catalyst for progress.""

 Duderstadt's main initiative in the area of finance, the Campaign for Michigan, was a highly successful capital campaign with a goal of raising $1 billion. The university endowment quadrupled to $1.3 billion, during Duderstadt's tenure as president. Placing the university on stable financial footing made it possible to carry out an ambitious effort to improve the school's infrastructure. Construction expenditures during Duderstadt's presidency are estimated to have been nearly $1 billion; large-scale projects included the Aerospace Building, a chemistry building, new engineering buildings on North Campus, and major renovations to Mott Children's Hospital and the Undergraduate Library.

 As part of efforts to improve the university's national academic standing, Duderstadt increased the overall research budget, placed a strong emphasis on technological research and education, and created an Office of Technology Transfer. However, concerns about the quality of undergraduate education, particularly class size and the lack of personal attention, continued to be serious issues for students.

 Other issues which were sources of controversy during Duderstadt's presidency were the deputization of campus police in 1991, which allowed them to carry guns, and what came to be known as ""The Code."" The latter - officially called the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities - was implemented in 1993 as a code of non-academic conduct for students. ""The Code"" was broadly cast. Perhaps its most controversial provisions were its attempts to deal with ""hate speech"" on campus, which many at the university believed were violations of students' freedom of speech. There were enough problems with ""The Code"" that it was treated as an interim policy, and by the end of Duderstadt's presidency, the regents were demanding that it be revised.

 Duderstadt took an active interest in university athletics, promoting restructuring of the NCAA, gender equity, and better education for student athletes. However, another source of friction during his presidency involved his relations with the Athletic Department. In 1993, he chose Joe Roberson to be the university's new athletic director. A selection committee had presented Duderstadt with four candidates for the position, but Roberson had not even been interviewed for the job. This decision was very unpopular with some members of the Athletic Department and a small but vocal group of alumni. At the end of his presidency, with the support of the regents, Duderstadt made plans to have the central administration of the university oversee Athletic Department business transactions. This decision was made after the department sold rights to the university logo and colors to the Nike company for $7 million, and after ex-football coach Gary Moeller's contract was bought out for over $380,000.

 Duderstadt's September 1995 announcement of his plan to resign in June 1996 caught most of the university community by surprise. The reasons he gave for resigning were that he had accomplished his major goals, and that he was eager to return to teaching and research as a member of the engineering faculty. The seemingly abrupt decision was the source of speculation about the motives for his resignation, however, Duderstadt had accomplished all his stated goals: the university was more culturally diverse, technologically advanced and in better financial condition than when he had taken office.

 Upon his departure as president of the University of Michigan, Duderstadt returned to the classroom as Professor of Science and Technology at Michigan. In addition, he heads the Millennium Project. The Millennium Project is a research center in the Media Union concerned with the impact of technology on research and teaching. Information about current research and a selection of Duderstadt's ""legacy documents"" are available on-line at: http://milproj.ummu.umich.edu.

  <emph render=""bold"">Homer Neal</emph>

 Homer Neal was born on June 13, 1942, in Franklin, Kentucky. He received his B.S. in physics from Indiana University in 1961, and an M.S. (1963) and Ph.D. (1966) from the University of Michigan. Neal taught at Indiana University from 1967 to 1981 and served as the dean of research and graduate development there from 1976 to 1981. From 1981 to 1986 he was the provost and vice president for academic affairs at the State University of New York Stony Brook.

 Neal joined the U-M faculty in 1987 as professor and chair of the Department of Physics. He was named Vice President for Research in 1993, a position he held until being asked to served as interim president when James Duderstadt stepped down in June 1996. Although his tenure as interim president was brief, he did begin several initiatives which were carried on by his successor, including establishing the $450,000 President's New Century Fund for Diversity and developing programs to expand research opportunities for undergraduates. Neal was the first African-American president at the University.

 After stepping down as interim president, Neal declined the opportunity to return to his position as Vice President for Research in favor of returning to his research in experimental high energy physics. He is the Samuel A. Goudsmit Professor of Physics in the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan and the Director of the ATLAS Project. He and his wife, Jean, were married in 1962 and have two children.

  <emph render=""bold"">Lee Bollinger</emph>

 Lee Bollinger was born on April 30, 1946, in Santa Rosa, California. He received a B.S. from the University of Oregon in 1968 and a J.D. from Columbia University in 1971. Bollinger joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School as an assistant professor in 1973. He rose to associate professor in 1976, full professor in 1979, and was appointed Dean of the Law School in 1987. Bollinger left Michigan for a brief time when he was named provost and professor of government at Dartmouth College in 1994. He returned to Michigan in February 1997 as the twelfth president of the University of Michigan. He stepped down in December 2001, after accepting the presidency of Columbia University.

 A noted First Amendment scholar, Bollinger's publications include The Tolerant Society: Freedom of Speech and Extremist Speech in America (Oxford University Press, 1986) and Images of a Free Press (University of Chicago Press, 1991). Bollinger and his wife Jean Magnano, an artist, have two children.

  <emph render=""bold"">Bollinger Administration (1997-2001)</emph>

 When Lee Bollinger assumed the Presidency in February 1997, many heralded his arrival as the return of a native son and an opportunity to return academics to the forefront of the University's priorities. He oversaw a period of tremendous growth and prosperity during which both admissions applications and fundraising contributions rose to record levels.

 Bollinger introduced new initiatives across disciplines at the university. In 1999 he launched the Life Sciences Initiative, a campus wide effort to coordinate and expand research in the life sciences, centered on the construction of a new Life Sciences Institute. Bollinger's passion for the arts led to plans for the construction of new performance spaces on campus, including the Walgreen Drama Center and the Arthur Miller Theater. Bollinger also brought the Royal Shakespeare Company to the university for a three-week residency in March 2001.

 Campus planning was a major priority of Bollinger's presidency. He commissioned Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates to develop a new campus master plan to inform construction decisions around the university campus in succeeding years. Bollinger also set in motion the restoration of two campus landmarks, Hill Auditorium and the Rackham Building, as well as Mason and Haven Halls. Bollinger was also instrumental in the naming of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and securing the funding for the A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. Other milestones of the Bollinger administration included reports and recommendations issued by two major commissions appointed by the president: the Commission on the Undergraduate Experience, which examined how undergraduates are engaged at the university, and the Information Revolution Commission, which studied the university's relationship to evolving technologies.

 Bollinger's tenure was not without controversies. The most visible were the ongoing lawsuits against the Law School and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts which argued that the university's admissions policies, which used race as one consideration in admissions decisions, were discriminatory. The lawsuits positioned the university at the center of the far-reaching debate over affirmative action in education, with Bollinger vigorously defending the university's practices and commitment to diversity to the university community and in national forums. The Athletics Department also saw controversy, with allegations of financial mismanagement, abrupt changes in personnel, and dissension over the university's continuing affiliation with Nike, which led to the creation of a Code of Conduct for manufacturers of apparel and other items licensed to display the school's logos.

 Bollinger's relative approachability made him well-liked and respected by faculty, students, staff, and alumni alike. His annual 5K fun run for students and regular meetings with students and faculty were emblematic of his approach to community relations. His decision to leave Michigan for Columbia University in December 2001 was met with disappointment in many circles of the university community. B. Joseph White, Dean of the Business School from 1991 to 2001, was named interim president effective January 1, 2002.

  <emph render=""bold"">B. Joseph White and White Administration (Interim, January 2002 -- July 2002)</emph>

 A native of Michigan, White received his B.S. degree from Georgetown University in 1969, his M.B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1971, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1975. He joined the University of Michigan faculty of the Ross School of Business Administration as a lecturer in 1973 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1975 and associate professor in 1978. In 1981, he took a leave of absence to join Cummins Engine Company, Inc., where he served as vice president for management development and vice president for personnel and public affairs. He returned to the University in 1987 as professor and associate dean of the Ross School of Business Administration. He was appointed interim dean in 1990 and dean in 1991. He served as dean until 2001. White was appointed the Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of Leadership in Management Education in 1999, and he served as interim president of the University of Michigan in 2002. In 2005 White was named dean emeritus of the Ross School of Business Administration and professor emeritus of business administration.

 As interim president White dealt with several significant issues including the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which claimed the lives of eighteen alumni, and the defense of the University's use of affirmative action in admissions. Professor White also continued to advance the Life Sciences Initiative, which had begun during President Bollinger's tenure.

  <emph render=""bold"">Mary Sue Coleman</emph>

 Mary Sue Coleman earned her undergraduate degree in chemistry from Grinnell College and her doctorate in biochemistry from the University of North Carolina. For 19 years she was a member of the biochemistry faculty at the University of Kentucky. As a biochemist, Coleman built a distinguished research career through her research on the immune system and malignancies. Her work in the sciences led to administrative appointments at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of New Mexico, where she served as provost and vice president for academic affairs. From 1995-2002, Coleman was president of the University of Iowa. In August 2002 Coleman was appointed the thirteenth president of the University of Michigan; she also holds appointments of professor of biological chemistry in the Medical School and professor of chemistry in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.

 President Coleman and her husband, Kenneth Coleman, a political scientist specializing in Latin America, resided in the historic President's House on the University campus. They had one son, Jonathan, who worked as a portfolio manager in Denver, Colorado. (Taken from Mary Sue Coleman's biography, available through the UM Office of the President website.)

  <emph render=""bold"">Coleman Administration (2002--2014)</emph>

 Following her appointment as president in August 2002, Coleman unveiled several major initiatives designed to impact future generations of students, the intellectual life of the campus, and society at large. These initiatives included the interdisciplinary richness of the U-M, student residential life, diversity, the economic vitality of the state and nation, ethics in our society, global engagement, and issues related to health care.

 Under her leadership, the University launched ""The Michigan Difference,"" a campaign to raise $2.5 billion for the future of the institution. At its conclusion in December 2008, the campaign finale stood at $3,200,733,103 -- the most ever by a public university.

 In 2004, Dr. Coleman also announced a groundbreaking partnership between the University and Google, which enabled the public to search the text of the University's 7-million-volume library and helped open the way to universal access and the preservation of recorded human knowledge.

 Coleman was a strong advocate of diversity. She defended the use of affirmative action in admissions, a practice that was challenged in two lawsuits initiated during the Bollinger administration. After Michigan voters removed affirmative action from admissions in 2006 with passage of Proposal 2 (Michigan Civil Rights Initiative), Coleman launched the Diversity Blueprints Task Force to gather ideas for how the university could continue to achieve diversity without affirmative action. During Coleman's tenure, the number of minority Ph.D. recipients was in the top 10 nationally and there was notable growth in the number of minority faculty members and increasing enrollment of students who were the first in their families to attend college or came from low-income families.

 Forging international partnerships, promoting global engagement, and strengthening ties with international alumni were priorities for Coleman. She traveled to China, South Africa, Ghana, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, and India to meet with higher education leaders. In 2006, the university and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University launched a joint institute for undergraduates studying engineering in Shanghai. In 2008, the university established the African Studies Center to provide guidance and coordination for Africa-related education and research and to promote opportunities for collaboration with African partners. In 2013, Coleman visited India and signed agreements with Indian partners to expand research in medicine and social science. She and her husband gave $1 million for international study scholarships.

 Strengthening support for research was another major Coleman initiative. Under her leadership, the university's annual research budget increased by 77 percent to more than $1.3 billion, the largest of any public university. One of the hallmarks of Coleman's tenure was the university's acquisition of the Pfizer global research headquarters in 2009. This property became the North Campus Research Complex, a center for multidisciplinary research groups, public-private partnerships, research support functions, and activities to strengthen and diversify Michigan's economy. Programs connected with research support included the Interdisciplinary Junior Faculty Initiative, and MCubed, which provided support for multidisciplinary research.

 Coleman was deeply involved in economic development at the state and local levels. She was a founding president of the University Research Corridor (URC), an economic development collaboration with Michigan State and Wayne State universities and one of the major players in creating Ann Arbor SPARK, the regional economic development agency. She also strongly supported the U-M Tech Transfer and was involved with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. Additionally, Coleman launched the U-M Business Engagement Center and was influential in increasing the number of course offerings in entrepreneurship.

 During the Coleman administration, the university engaged in several major building projects, including North Quad, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital, Weill Hall, Ross Business School complex, a new School of Nursing building, and a renovation of Michigan Stadium.

 In 2013, Coleman announced that she would retire after June 2014 when her contract expired. Her plans after concluding her tenure included advocating at the national level for higher education and scientific research support and diversity as well as serving on the Advisory Committee to the Director of the National Institutes of Health and on the Board of Directors for Society for Science and the Public.

Mark Steven Schlissel received his BA in Biochemical Sciences from Princeton University in 1979. He went on to earn an MD and Ph.D at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he became a faculty member in 1991. In 1999 Schlissel accepted a position as associate professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California-Berkeley. He advanced to full professor in 2002 and served as the department’s vice chair from 2002-2007. In 2008 he was UC-Berkeley’s dean of biological sciences in the College of Letters and Science, a position he held until he was appointed provost of Brown University in 2011. 

<emph render=""bold"">Schlissel Administration (2014--2022)</emph>

Schlissel succeeded President Coleman in July 2014, and is the first physician-scientist to lead U-M. Since his inauguration, he has launched a variety of initiatives, including Academic Innovation; Biosciences; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; and Poverty Solutions. In June 2017, Schlissel announced the Go Blue Guarantee, a financial aid program that provides up to four years of free undergraduate tuition to in-state students from Michigan families earning $65,000 or less.

The collection includes histories of the club, papers read at club meetings, member lists and club correspondence, and assorted photographs of club gatherings",The finding aid is written in English,"The records of the Scientific Club include club attendance records and correspondence, histories of the club prepared by members on several occasions, papers presented by members at club meetings on academic topics, memorials of club members, and photographs of club events. The records are not complete, but span the history of the club, from 1883 to 2006, with no particular concentration. The collection is made up of four series: Club Histories, Papers Presented, Club Records, and Photographs.","The Scientific Club is a scholarly and social dining club of University of Michigan faculty members from all fields. The club was founded in 1883 to promote collegiality and awareness of scholarly interests and research among the faculty.

 The Scientific Club succeeded an earlier organization, the Ann Arbor Scientific Association, founded by several university faculty members and local residents in 1875. The association hosted gatherings at which papers were read on various topics, including ""the elevation of the arctic regions, Indian mounds in Genesee County, the aromatic group in the chemistry of plants, the history of the theory of spontaneous generation, the colored snowfall in northern Michigan, and antiquities of Peru.""[1]

 The club apparently fell into difficulties due to a financial scandal involving two prominent members, Silas H. Douglas and Preston B. Rose, both chemistry professors. Subsequently, several members of the Scientific Association decided to form a new, less formal group, to be named the Scientific Club. Twenty men associated with the university were the original members, later to be joined by the university president as a member ex officio. The founders of the club hoped to keep their meetings simple and convivial, with academic exchange and refreshments consisting of apples, doughnuts, and sweet cider. There was to be minimal organizational structure and no rules, with one club officer, the ""Principal Servant,"" handling organizational and scheduling responsibilities.

 Over subsequent decades, the club continued its meetings more or less regularly on a monthly basis. Based on the amount of attention paid to it in numerous club histories, the most memorable feature of the events was the changing nature of the collation offered to members, ranging from roast beef sandwiches served without plates or silverware on laboratory tables to increasingly sophisticated dinners served, beginning in the 1960s, in the homes of members.

 Guests may be invited to club meetings, but have been rare, although notable exceptions include W.H. Auden and the Danish explorer, World War II resistance fighter and quiz-show champion Peter Freuchen. [2] Women were not initially welcomed at the meetings, with the ""hostess"" of a meeting expected to provide a meal ""in absentia,"" but members' wives gradually began to show themselves during the meal and even ""to mingle briefly with the entire group."" [3] Members' wives were invited to join in the dinner and meeting beginning in 1970. The first female members were named in 1977.

2710,umich-bhl-87290,Vice President for Student Life (University of Michigan) Records,"University of Michigan administrative office, established as the Dean of Student Affairs in 1921, responsible for overseeing many aspects of non-academic student services and activities including at various times: counseling, financial aid, student housing, student activities and organizations, health services, student discipline, and fraternities and sororities. Records provide extensive documentation of student life.","The finding aid is written in <language encodinganalog=""language"" langcode=""eng"">English.</language>","The records of the Vice President for Student Life provide a unique perspective to the extracurricular life and customs of students at the University of Michigan and an insight to the development of the office of the Vice President. The records span the years 1908-2005 with the bulk of the material covering 1941-1995. The material from the early years is especially rich in documenting student life from the 1920s to the 1950s. The strongest feature of this collection is in documenting the administration's response to the needs and to the demands of student, ranging from disciplining drinkers during Prohibition, dealings with fraternities up to 1960, reacting to student protests in the 1960s to the 1988 debate over the Student Code for Non-Academic Conduct, and the 2000 protest against Michigamua. The records also contain materials related to students' health, housing, organizations, and activism. The coverage of these areas varies across administrations as office reorganizations altered the focus and functions of Student Services.

 This uneven documentation reflects the fact that, over time, different offices were created to handle more narrowly-defined areas of responsibility. Areas which had originally been handled by Dean Bursley under his broad conception of control over non-academic student life came to be administered by separate offices. Frequently the records of these administrative units were not included with the Vice President for Student Life records. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of student life, as refracted through the lens of University Administration, one should also refer to the records of the Housing Office and Student-Community Relations Office, and the papers of Peter Ostafin, director of housing.

 The Vice President for Student Life collection consists of correspondence, reports, memos, minutes, and financial reports generated by both the University Administration and students. These materials are arranged in chronological series by the administrative head in charge of students' extracurricular affairs. Nine series represent records of Vice Presidents of the office: Joseph A. Bursley, 1913-1950; Erich A. Walter, 1925-1959; James A. Lewis, 1908-1964; Richard L. Cutler, 1950-1969; Barbara W. Newell, 1965-1970; Robert L. Knauss, 1962-1973; Henry Johnson, 1950-1985; Mary Ann Swain and Maureen Hartford, 1990-2005; and E. Royster Harper, 2000. In addition, the collections includes a Topical Files series, 1953-1995 (records of several Vice Presidents that have been received by the Bentley in various accessions); as well as a Printed Materials series. 
 
 This organizing scheme required some manipulation of the files, but it best enables the researcher to trace the changing nature of the student body concerns and the development of the office itself.

 The researcher should note that the strict chronological sequencing of the series was not possible. This was due in large part to a series of office reorganizations which resulted in some files created during Bursley or Walter's tenure ending up in later series. The most significant move here resulted in Lewis' series containing a good deal of Bursley and Walter materials on fraternities and student organizations. Lewis created the fraternities subseries in 1959 and compiled the student organization subseries during a May 1963, office reorganization. The researcher should also be conscious that early series contain a variety of materials which may not reflect the full scope of Bursley, Walter, or Lewis' responsibilities. Gaps are also discernible in the later series, but these are more readily fleshed out by referring to other University collections.","The position of Vice President for Student Life traces its history back through the Vice President of Student Services, Vice President for Student Affairs, to the Director of the Office of Student Affairs, finally to the Office of the Dean of Students. Through all of these changes in the name, the office's primary responsibility has been the administration of programs related to the life of the student outside of the classroom. This encompasses a broad spectrum of programs dealing with counseling, financial aid, student housing, student activities and organizations, health and mental services, student discipline, and fraternities. The office reflects the changing interests and composition of the student body and the increasing complexity of the University's administrative organization.

 Joseph A. Bursley, the first Dean of Students, took office February 1, 1921, to fulfill the Regents' mandate to act ""as friend, counselor and guide to the student body and to have the general oversight of its welfare and of its general activities."" Given this open-ended directive, Bursley soon found need to add an Assistant Dean and support staff to meet his mission tending to the housing, financial, social, and moral needs of students. By the time Bursley retired in 1945, the pattern of assuming increasing responsibilities with a larger staff and more complex administration was well established.

 The growing administrative structure, retirement of Bursley, and the University's increasing student enrollment led to the creation of the Office of Student Affairs in September 1945. This was the first of a series of periodic efforts to define more clearly the duties of the various offices concerned with different aspects of students' lives outside the classroom. Erich A. Walter served as director of the Office of Student Affairs from 1945 until June 1954. Upon Walter's retirement, James A. Lewis was appointed vice-president for student affairs. This new title reflected the hierarchical nature of both the office and the university as a whole. Lewis stepped down in December 1964, after another reorganization of the office.

 During the latter half of the 1960s and early 1970s, the University of Michigan campus was affected by student protests focused on the war in Vietnam as well as campus and national issues. Sit-ins, teach-ins, and more intemperate forms of student protest took place on campus, forcing the administration to act more responsively to student input. It has been decided to reorganize the office of Vice-President of Student Affairs once again. Richard L. Cutler served from December 1964 until the completion of the office reorganization in July 1968. Barbara W. Newell became Acting Vice President on August 1, 1968 and served until September 1970. Robert Knauss succeeded her as the Vice President of the renamed Office for Student Services and held the post until February 1972.  

 In April 1972, Henry Johnson became the Vice President for Student Services. Under his leadership, structural changes were introduced to address the needs of marginalized groups of students, who protested the University's lack of response to their needs. The offices of Minority Student Services and Disabled Student Services provided an official framework within which to advance student interests and needs. In January 1990, Henry Johnson was reassigned to the position of Vice President for Community Affair. Mary Ann Swain acted as interim vice president for student services from 1990 to 1992.

 In 1992, Maureen Hartford began her tenure as the Vice President for Student Affairs. Hartford was previously the Vice Provost for Student Affairs at Washington State University and quickly rose to the task by focusing on issues such as the Student Code of Conduct, alcohol abuse, living/learning programs and students rights and responsibilities. In April 1999, Hartford left her position to assume the presidency of Meredith College in North Carolina. E. Royster Harper, who had served as the Senior Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students then assumed the role of the Interim Vice President for Student Affairs.  

 
 In February 2000, the Students of Color Coalition organized a 37-day protest against Michigamua inside the Michigan Union, that attracted national attention. Michigamua was a social University of Michigan student society, established in 1902. Its members employed pseudo-Native American practices and rituals, cartoonish imagery, and degrading language. The organization's Michigan Union headquarters (occupied rent-free, in contradiction with the U-M policies), displayed offensive images as well as appropriated Native American artifacts and pseudo-Native American objects. In the wake of the protests, Harper commissioned a panel to decide on the Michigamua's Union space. Following the panel decision, Michigamua relocated its headquarters. Native American artifacts were transferred to the U-M Museum of Natural History. In 2007, Michigamua adopted a new name, The Order of Angell. The organization disbanded in 2021. Bentley Historical Library houses a collection of [Michigamua] <title href=""https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-87248"" show=""new"" actuate=""onrequest""> The Order of Angell records</title>. 

 In November 2000, Harper was appointed the Vice President of Student Affairs. Harper focused her efforts on the enhancement of well-being and mental health services, multicultural dining options and prevention of food insecurity, and availability of safe inclusive spaces for study and other activities on campus. During her tenure, the U-M introduced gender-inclusive bathrooms and residential spaces; opened reflection rooms and multicultural lounges; expanded living-learning, dining, and fresh-food access options; and secured the Blavin Scholars program for students growing up in foster care. Harper led two phases of Residential Life Initiatives resulting in the construction of North Quad Residential and Academic Complex and the creation of the new William Monroe Trotter Multicultural Center on Central Campus. In 2013, following Harper's proposal, the Division of Student Affairs was renamed Student Life, ""which better reflects the core work, and will create a clearer and more meaningful connection to students"" (Board of Regents Proceedings). 

 
 Harper retired from the U-M in 2019. Simone Himbeault Taylor served as the interim Vice President until July 1, 2020, when Martino Harmon became the Vice President for Student Life.

The Football subseries consists of ten envelopes of negatives, four of which pertain to the 1951 Rose Bowl. The Other campus photographs subseries contains images of student groups, dances, campus landscapes and buildings, and other campus events during Wise's tenure as a student from 1948-1951.
