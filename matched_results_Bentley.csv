Between 1914 and 1917, Kahn had constructed the first hangar building ever built at Langley Field, the Ford Eagle Shipbuilding Factory at River Rouge and the majority of the country's World War I naval bases and army airfields. In the last three years of his life, his firm took on the bulk of the U. S. Defense Department's contracts for World War II, totaling $200 million. These included naval bases in Alaska, Hawaii, Midway Island, Puerto Rico and Jacksonville, Florida. Kahn also constructed the Chrysler Tank Arsenal (1941) and numerous airplane factories, the largest of which was the 70-acre Ford Motor Company Willow Run Bomber factory (1943) at Ypsilanti, Michigan. Willow Run was Kahn's last industrial project for Ford. The B-24 Liberator bomber was produced here in a 4,000,000-square-foot, artificially lighted assembly plant to guard against the threat of night attack. This was the world's largest industrial facility, producing one bomber every 24 hours. In 1942, just before Kahn's death, the American Institute of Architects presented him with a special award, the citation for which read:"

His brother Paul was already a student at Michigan by the time Richard began classes in the Fall of 1934. While in Ann Arbor, Richard was employed as a student manager and accountant at the popular student hangout the Pretzel Bell Tavern. The Pretzel Bell opened in 1934 just shortly after the repeal of Prohibition. The Pretzel Bell, located at 120 E. Liberty Street, was a few blocks west of Ann Arbor's dry line. During this time, any establishment east of Division Street was prohibited to sell liquor. Therefore, students wanting to buy a drink would have to venture to establishments located outside Ann Arbor's dry territory like the Pretzel Bell. ""The P-Bell,"" as it was commonly known, quickly became a popular, co-educational social center. At one point during his time in Ann Arbor, Richard lived in an apartment above the restaurant."

Comprising more than 75% of the Hayden papers, the Philippine Collection is testimony to Hayden's foresight in drawing together official documents (because of the positions he held) and other records (sent to him because of his known interest in the Philippines).

Up until that time, salesmen usually followed carloads of their companies' furniture into various cities along the train route.

In 1923-24, Dr. Margaret Bell became Associate Professor of Women's Physical Education but this work was felt to be more appropriate under the University Health Service. In further recognition of its public health obligations, the university organized a Division of Hygiene and Public Health in 1921.

In the wake of the protests, Harper commissioned a panel to decide on the Michigamua's Union space. Following the panel decision, Michigamua relocated its headquarters.

Benz, as an amateur photographer, was interested in the common events that he experienced as he traveled. The collection features extensive recordings of people working or playing, and children of different cultures going about their daily activities. The films show barren huts in remote areas of Russia in the 1930s, families living under stone bridges outside of Buenos Aires, life-saving competitions in Sydney and the plethora of street markets found in most cultures and countries that he traveled through."

Throughout the 1910s decade, the brothers expanded their interests into the area of automotive accessories. In the early 1920s, they opened a Chevrolet dealership. Fred retained an interest in the business but relinquished the operation of Benz Brothers to Albert and became the treasurer of the Ann Arbor Finance Company in 1928. In 1931, he left that position and became vice-president and secretary of The National Company of Ann Arbor. He retired in 1932 but retained his interest in the Benz Brothers operation. Very little additional information exists relating to Benz. He married in 1916 to a woman named Margaret and the marriage lasted until his death in 1963.

Except for this time in the Far East, Bandholtz was always on the move with ever changing assignments, and consequently his files covering his work on the Mexican border, for example, or the 1921 West Virginia coal miners strike (also known as the Battle of Blair Mountain) are substantially thinner. But in the Philippines, because he was a provincial governor and head of the indigenous military force, Bandholtz was at the center of affairs in this period of Philippine history. And beyond that, he made an effort to maintain and preserve as much documentation from his service here as he could."

Between 1898 and 1900, he held different positions in the United States and Cuba. In July 1900, he left Cuba for the Philippine Islands where he served for the next thirteen years.

In 1903, he was appointed assistant chief of Philippine Constabulary with the temporary rank of colonel and placed in command of the District of Southern Luzon. Bandholtz was an effective commander who arranged for the unconditional surrender of insurgent general Simeon Ola and his forces in Albay. In 1905, he was transferred to the District of Central Luzon where he similarly apprehended Philippine bandit leaders. In 1907, he was appointed chief of Philippine Constabulary with the temporary rank of brigadier general. He held this position until relieved on September 1, 1913."

The Personnel Division was initially headed up by Ron Thayer. Shelby Solomon next ran the office.

The university was looking for a professor in bankruptcy and reorganization after the death of professor Edgar Durfee, and Michigan persuaded him to return. He returned as a permanent professor in 1961, and remained at the university until 1984 when he was given emeritus status. He came to Michigan because of the opportunity to dedicate more of his teaching and scholarly time to bankruptcy-related issues. While at Michigan he taught creditor's rights, bankruptcy, reorganization, secured transactions, and consumer credit. He received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement award in 1971. He was named the Thomas M. Cooley Professor of Law in 1979. Over time he has contributed prodigious scholarship to the field of bankruptcy law by having almost 170 articles published in law reviews or contributed to legal treatises. In 1997 he was recognized for fifty years of membership in the Association of American University Professors."
